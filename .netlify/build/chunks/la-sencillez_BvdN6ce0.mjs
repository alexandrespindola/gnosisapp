    "set:html": "<p>It is urgent, it is indispensable to develop creative understanding because it brings true freedom of living to the human being. Without understanding, it is impossible to achieve the authentic critical faculty of deep analysis.</p>\n<p>Teachers in schools, colleges and universities must lead their pupils along the path of self-critical understanding.</p>\n<p>In our previous chapter we already studied extensively the processes of envy and if we want to eliminate all the nuances of jealousy, whether religious, passionate, etc., we must become fully aware of what envy really is, because only by understanding deeply and intimately the infinite processes of envy, can we eliminate jealousy of all kinds.</p>\n<p>Jealousy destroys marriages, jealousy destroys friendships, jealousy provokes religious wars, fratricidal hatred, murders and sufferings of all kinds.</p>\n<p>Envy with all its infinite nuances hides behind sublime purposes. Envy exists in the person who, having been informed about the existence of sublime saints. Mahatmas or Gurus, also wishes to become a saint. Envy exists in the philanthropist who strives to surpass other philanthropists. Envy exists in every individual who covets virtues because he had reports, because in his mind there is data about the existence of sacred individuals full of virtues.</p>\n<p>The desire to be a saint, the desire to be virtuous, the desire to be great is based on envy.</p>\n<p>The saints with their virtues have caused much damage. We are reminded of the case of a man who considered himself very holy.</p>\n<p>On one occasion a hungry and miserable poet knocked on his doors to put in his hands a beautiful verse specially dedicated to the saint of our story. The poet only expected a coin to buy food for his exhausted and aged body.</p>\n<p>The poet imagined everything but an insult. Great was his surprise when the saint with a pious look and a frown closed the door saying to the unhappy poet: “get out of here friend, away, away… I don’t like these things, I abhor flattery… I don’t like the vanities of the world, this life is an illusion… I follow the path of humility and modesty. The unhappy poet who only wanted a coin instead of this received the insult of the saint, the word that hurts, the slap, and with a sore heart and the lyre turned to pieces he went through the streets of the city slowly… slowly… slowly.</p>\n<p>The new generation must rise on the basis of authentic understanding because it is totally creative.</p>\n<p>Memory and remembrance are not creative. Memory is the tomb of the past. Memory and remembrance are death.</p>\n<p>True understanding is the psychological factor of total liberation.</p>\n<p>The memories of memory can never bring us true liberation because they belong to the past and therefore are dead.</p>\n<p>Understanding is not a thing of the past nor of the future. Understanding belongs to the moment we are living here and now. Memory always brings the idea of the future.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to study science, philosophy, art and religion, but studies should not be entrusted to the fidelity of memory because it is not faithful.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to deposit knowledge in the tomb of memory. It is stupid to bury in the pit of the past the knowledge that we must understand.</p>\n<p>We could never pronounce ourselves against study, against wisdom, against science, but it is incongruous to deposit the living jewels of knowledge among the corrupted sepulcher of memory.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to study, it is necessary to investigate, it is necessary to analyze, but we must meditate deeply to understand at all levels of the mind.</p>\n<p>The truly simple man is deeply understanding and has a simple mind.</p>\n<p>The important thing in life is not what we have accumulated in the tomb of memory, but what we have understood not only on the intellectual level but also in the different subconscious unconscious terrains of the mind.</p>\n<p>Science, knowledge, must become immediate understanding. When knowledge, when study has been transformed into authentic creative understanding we can then understand all things immediately because understanding becomes immediate, instantaneous.</p>\n<p>In the simple man there are no complications in the mind because every complication of the mind is due to memory. The Machiavellian SELF that we carry inside is accumulated memory.</p>\n<p>The experiences of life must be transformed into true understanding.</p>\n<p>When experiences do not become understanding, when experiences continue in memory, they constitute the rot of the sepulcher over which burns the fatuous and luciferic flame of the intellect.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to know that the animal intellect totally devoid of all spirituality is only the verbalization of memory, the sepulchral candle burning on the funeral slab.</p>\n<p>The simple man has a mind free of experiences because these have become consciousness, have been transformed into creative understanding.</p>\n<p>Death and life are intimately associated. Only by dying does the grain grow into the plant, only by dying does the experience give birth to understanding. This is a process of authentic transformation.</p>\n<p>The complicated man has a memory full of experiences.</p>\n<p>This demonstrates his lack of creative understanding because when experiences are fully understood at all levels of the mind they cease to exist as experiences and are born as understanding.</p>\n<p>It is necessary first to experiment, but we must not stay in the field of experience because then the mind becomes complicated and difficult. It is necessary to live life intensely and transform all experiences into authentic creative understanding.</p>\n<p>Those who mistakenly assume that in order to be understanding, simple and uncomplicated we have to abandon the world, become beggars, live in isolated huts and wear loincloths instead of elegant clothes, are totally wrong.</p>\n<p>Many anchorites, many solitary hermits, many beggars, have very complicated and difficult minds.</p>\n<p>It is useless to withdraw from the world and live as anchorites if the memory is full of experiences that condition the free flow of thought.</p>\n<p>It is useless to live as hermits wanting to lead the life of saints if the memory is filled with information that has not been properly understood, that has not become conscious in the different nooks, corridors and unconscious regions of the mind.</p>\n<p>Those who transform intellectual information into true creative understanding, those who transform the experiences of life into true deep understanding have nothing in memory, live from moment to moment full of true fullness, have become simple and uncomplicated even though they live in sumptuous residences and within the perimeter of urban life.</p>\n<p>Small children before the age of seven are full of simplicity and true inner beauty because only the living ESSENCE of life expresses itself through them in the total absence of the PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF.</p>\n<p>We must reconquer the lost childhood, in our heart and in our mind. We must reconquer innocence if we truly want to be happy.</p>\n<p>Experiences and study transformed into deep understanding leave no residue in the tomb of memory and then, we become simple, uncomplicated, innocent, happy.</p>\n<p>Deep meditation on experiences and acquired knowledge, deep self-criticism, intimate psychoanalysis convert, transform everything into deep creative understanding. This is the path of authentic happiness born of wisdom and love.</p>"
