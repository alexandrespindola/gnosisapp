    "set:html": "<p>Millions of students from all countries around the world go to school and university every day unconsciously, automatically, subjectively, without knowing why or what for.</p>\n<p>Students are forced to study Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, etc.</p>\n<p>The minds of students are receiving daily information, but they never stop for a moment to think about the reason for that information, the objective of that information.</p>\n<p>Why do we fill ourselves with that information? What do we fill ourselves with that information for?</p>\n<p>Students really live a mechanistic life and only know that they have to receive intellectual information and keep it stored in their unreliable memory, that is all.</p>\n<p>It never occurs to students to think about what this education really is, they go to school or university because their parents send them and that’s all.</p>\n<p>Neither the students, nor the teachers, ever think to ask themselves: Why am I here? What have I come here for? What is really the true secret motive that brings me here?</p>\n<p>Teachers, male students and female students, live with a sleeping consciousness, they act like real automatons, they go to school and university unconsciously, subjectively, without really knowing anything about the why, or the what for.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to stop being automatons, to awaken consciousness, to discover for themselves what this terrible struggle is to pass exams, to study, to live in a certain place to study daily and to suffer scares, anxieties, worries, to play sports, to fight with schoolmates, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Teachers must become more aware in order to cooperate from the school or university, helping students to awaken consciousness.</p>\n<p>It is regrettable to see so many AUTOMATONS sitting in the benches of schools and universities, receiving information that they must keep in their memory without knowing why or what for.</p>\n<p>The boys only worry about passing the year; they have been told that they must prepare themselves to earn a living, to get a job, etc. And they study, forming a thousand fantasies in their minds with respect to the future, without really knowing the present, without knowing the real reason why they should study physics, chemistry, biology, arithmetic, geography, etc.</p>\n<p>Modern girls study to have the preparation that allows them to get a good husband, or to earn a living and be properly prepared in case the husband abandons them, or they become widows or spinsters.</p>\n<p>Pure fantasies in the mind because they really do not know what their future will be or at what age they will die.</p>\n<p>Life at school is very vague, very incoherent, very subjective, the child is sometimes made to learn certain subjects that in practical life are useless.</p>\n<p>Today, the important thing in school is to pass the year and that is all.</p>\n<p>In other times there was at least some more ethics in this passing the year. Now there is no such ETHICS. The parents can bribe the teacher in great secrecy and the boy or girl, even if they are a TERRIBLE STUDENT, will pass the year INEVITABLY.</p>\n<p>The girls at school tend to suck up to the teacher with the purpose of PASSING THE YEAR and the result is usually wonderful, even if they have not understood a ‘J’ of what the teacher teaches, they still do well in the EXAMS and pass the year.</p>\n<p>There are very clever boys and girls to pass the year. This is a matter of cunning in many cases.</p>\n<p>A boy who victoriously passes a certain exam (some stupid exam) does not mean that he has true objective awareness, about that subject in which he was examined.</p>\n<p>The student repeats like a parrot, mechanically, that subject that he studied and in which he was examined.</p>\n<p>That is not being SELF-CONSCIOUS of that subject, that is memorizing and repeating like parrots what we have learned and that is all.</p>\n<p>Passing exams, passing the year, does not mean BEING VERY INTELLIGENT. In practical life we have known very intelligent people who never did well in exams at school. We have known magnificent writers and great mathematicians who were terrible students at school and who never passed the exams in grammar and mathematics well.</p>\n<p>We know of the case of a terrible student in ANATOMY who only after much suffering was able to do well in the ANATOMY exams. Today, this student is the author of a great work on ANATOMY.</p>\n<p>Passing the year does not necessarily mean being very intelligent. There are people who have never passed a year and who are very intelligent.</p>\n<p>There is something more important than passing the year, there is something more important than studying certain subjects and it is precisely to have full OBjective, clear and luminous awareness about those subjects that are studied.</p>\n<p>Teachers must strive to help students awaken consciousness; all the effort of the teachers must be directed to the consciousness of the students. It is URGENT that students become fully SELF-CONSCIOUS of those subjects they study.</p>\n<p>Learning by heart, learning like parrots, is simply STUPID in the fullest sense of the word.</p>\n<p>Students are forced to study difficult subjects and store them in their memory to ‘PASS THE YEAR’ and then in practical life these subjects not only turn out to be useless but are also forgotten because memory is unreliable.</p>\n<p>The boys study with the purpose of getting a job and earning a living and later if they are lucky enough to get such a job, if they become professionals, doctors, lawyers, etc., all they get is to repeat the same story as always, they get married, they suffer, they have children and they die without having awakened consciousness, they die without having had awareness of their own lives. That is all.</p>\n<p>The girls get married, form their homes, have children, fight with the neighbours, with the husband, with the children, get divorced and remarry, become widows, become old, etc. and finally die after having lived ASLEEP, UNCONSCIOUS, repeating as always the same PAINFUL DRAMA of existence.</p>\n<p>The SCHOOL TEACHERS do not want to fully realise that all human beings have a sleeping consciousness. It is urgent that the school teachers also awaken so that they can awaken the students.</p>\n<p>It is useless to fill our heads with theories and more theories and to quote Dante, Homer; Virgil, etc., if we have a sleeping consciousness if we do not have objective, clear and perfect awareness about ourselves, about the subjects we study, about practical life.</p>\n<p>What good is education if we do not become creators, conscious, truly intelligent?</p>\n<p>True education does not consist of knowing how to read and write. Any halfwit, any fool can know how to read and write.</p>\n<p>We need to be INTELLIGENT and INTELLIGENCE only awakens in us when CONSCIOUSNESS awakens.</p>\n<p>Humanity has ninety-seven percent of SUBCONSCIOUSNESS and three percent of CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>We need to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS, we need to convert the SUBCONSCIOUS into CONSCIOUS. We need to have one hundred percent consciousness.</p>\n<p>The human being not only dreams when his physical body sleeps, but also dreams when his physical body does not sleep, when he is in a state of wakefulness.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to stop dreaming, it is necessary to awaken consciousness and that process of awakening must begin from the home and from the school.</p>\n<p>The effort of the teachers must be directed to the CONSCIOUSNESS of the students and not only to the memory.</p>\n<p>Students must learn to think for themselves and not only to repeat like parrots the theories of others.</p>\n<p>Teachers must fight to eliminate fear in students.</p>\n<p>Teachers must allow students the freedom to dissent and constructively criticise all the theories they study.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to force them to accept in a DOGMATIC way all the theories that are taught in the school or university.</p>\n<p>It is necessary for students to abandon fear so that they learn to think for themselves. It is urgent for students to abandon fear so that they can analyse the theories they study.</p>\n<p>Fear is one of the barriers to intelligence. The fearful student does NOT dare to dissent and accepts as an article of BLIND FAITH, everything that the different authors say.</p>\n<p>It is useless for teachers to talk about intrepidity if they themselves are afraid. Teachers must be free from fear. Teachers who fear criticism, what people will say, etc., CANNOT be truly intelligent.</p>\n<p>The true objective of education must be to eliminate fear and awaken consciousness.</p>\n<p>What good is passing exams if we continue to be fearful and unconscious?</p>\n<p>Teachers have the duty to help students from the school benches so that they are useful in life, but as long as fear exists, no one can be useful in life.</p>\n<p>The person full of fear does not dare to dissent from the opinion of others.</p>\n<p>The person full of fear cannot have free initiative.</p>\n<p>It is the function of every teacher, evidently, to help each and every one of the students in their school to be completely free from fear, so that they can act spontaneously without needing to be told, to be ordered.</p>\n<p>It is urgent that students leave fear so that they can have free spontaneous and creative initiative.</p>\n<p>When students, by their own initiative, freely and spontaneously can analyse and freely criticise those theories they study, they will then stop being mere mechanical, subjective and stupid entities.</p>\n<p>It is urgent that free initiative exists so that creative intelligence arises in the students.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to give freedom of spontaneous CREATIVE EXPRESSION without conditioning of any kind, to all the students so that they can become aware of what they study.</p>\n<p>Free creative power can only manifest itself when we are not afraid of criticism, what people will say, the teacher’s rule, the rules etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The human mind is degenerated by fear and dogmatism and it is URGENT to regenerate it through free spontaneous and fearless initiative.</p>\n<p>We need to become aware of our own lives and that process of awakening must begin from the school benches themselves.</p>\n<p>The school will have been of little use to us if we leave it unconscious and asleep.</p>\n<p>The abolition of fear and free initiative will give rise to spontaneous and pure action.</p>\n<p>By free initiative the students should have the right in all schools to discuss in assembly all the theories they are studying.</p>\n<p>Only in this way, through the liberation from fear and the freedom to discuss, analyse, MEDITATE, and healthily criticise what we are studying, can we become aware of those subjects and not merely parrots that repeat what they accumulate in their memory.</p>"
