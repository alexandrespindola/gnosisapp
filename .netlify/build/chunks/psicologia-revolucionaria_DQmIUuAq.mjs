Any comparative study of Religions demonstrates that in the most Orthodox SACRED LITERATURE of various countries and different eras, there are wonderful treasures of PSYCHOLOGICAL science.</p>\n<p>In-depth research in the field of GNOSTICISM allows us to find that wonderful compilation of various Gnostic authors that comes from the early times of Christianity and is known under the title of PHILOKALIA, still used in our days in the EASTERN CHURCH, especially for the instruction of monks.</p>\n<p>Beyond any doubt and without the slightest fear of falling into deception, we can emphatically affirm that PHILOKALIA is essentially PURE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.</p>\n<p>In the ANCIENT SCHOOLS OF MYSTERIES of Greece, Egypt, Rome, India, Persia, Mexico, Peru, Assyria, Chaldea, etc. Etc. etc., PSYCHOLOGY was always linked to philosophy, to Real objective Art, to science and to Religion.</p>\n<p>In ancient times PSYCHOLOGY was intelligently hidden among the graceful forms of the Sacred Dancers, or among the enigma of the strange Hieroglyphs or the beautiful sculptures, or in poetry, or in tragedy and even in the delicious music of the temples.</p>\n<p>Before Science, Philosophy, Art and Religion separated to turn independently, PSYCHOLOGY reigned supreme in all the ANCIENT SCHOOLS OF MYSTERIES.</p>\n<p>When the Initiatic Colleges closed due to the KALIYUGA, or DARK AGE in which we still are, PSYCHOLOGY survived among the symbolism of the various ESOTERIC and PSEUDO-ESOTERIC SCHOOLS of the MODERN WORLD and especially among GNOSTIC ESOTERICISM.</p>\n<p>Deep analyses and in-depth research allow us to understand with all meridian clarity that the different Psychological systems and doctrines that existed in the past and that exist in the present can be divided into two categories.</p>\n<p>First.- The doctrines as many intellectuals suppose them. Modern Psychology belongs in fact to this category.</p>\n<p>Second.- The doctrines that study man from the point of view of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>These last are truly the original Doctrines, the oldest, only they allow us to understand the living origins of Psychology and its profound significance.</p>\n<p>When we all have understood in an integral way and at all LEVELS OF THE MIND, how important is the study of man from the new point of view of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, we will then understand that Psychology is the study of the principles, laws and facts intimately related to the RADICAL and definitive TRANSFORMATION of the INDIVIDUAL.</p>\n<p>It is urgent that Teachers and Lecturers in schools, colleges and universities fully understand the CRITICAL hour in which we live and the catastrophic state of Psychological disorientation in which the new Generation finds itself.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to channel the “NEW WAVE” along the path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS and this is only possible through the REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.</p>"
