    "set:html": "<p>Those who have dedicated themselves to travelling through all the countries of the world with the purpose of studying all the human races in detail have been able to verify for themselves that the nature of this poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL, mistakenly called man, is always the same, whether in old Europe or in Africa tired of so much slavery, in the sacred land of the Vedas or in the West Indies, in Austria or in China.</p>\n<p>This concrete fact, this tremendous reality that amazes every studious man, can be especially verified if the traveller visits Schools, Colleges and Universities.</p>\n<p>We have reached the era of mass production. Now everything is produced on a successive belt and on a large scale. Series of Aeroplanes, Cars, Luxury Goods, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Although it may be a little grotesque, it is very true that Industrial Schools, Universities, etc. have also become intellectual factories of mass production.</p>\n<p>In these times of mass production, the only objective in life is to find economic security. People are afraid of everything and seek security.</p>\n<p>Independent thought in these times of mass production is almost impossible because the modern type of Education is based on mere conveniences.</p>\n<p>“The New Wave” lives very comfortably with this intellectual mediocrity. If someone wants to be different, distinct from others, everyone disqualifies them, everyone criticises them, they are ostracised, they are denied work, etc.</p>\n<p>The desire to get money to live and have fun, the urgency to achieve success in life, the search for economic security, the desire to buy many things to show off to others, etc., put a stop to pure, natural and spontaneous thought.</p>\n<p>It has been fully proven that fear dulls the mind and hardens the heart.</p>\n<p>In these times of so much fear and search for security, people hide in their caves, in their burrows, in their corner, in the place where they believe they can have more security, fewer problems and they don’t want to leave there, they are terrified of life, afraid of new adventures, new experiences, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>All this so MUCH-TALKED-ABOUT modern education is based on fear and the search for security, people are terrified, they are afraid of their own shadow.</p>\n<p>People are terrified of everything, they are afraid to leave the old established norms, to be different from other people, to think in a revolutionary way, to break with all the prejudices of the decadent Society, etc.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there live in the world a few sincere and understanding people who truly wish to examine all the problems of the mind deeply, but in the great majority of us there does not even exist the spirit of nonconformity and rebellion.</p>\n<p>There are two types of REBELLION that are already duly classified. First: Violent Psychological Rebellion. Second: Deep Psychological Rebellion of INTELLIGENCE.</p>\n<p>The first type of Rebellion is reactionary, conservative and retardative. The second type of Rebellion is REVOLUTIONARY.</p>\n<p>In the first type of Psychological Rebellion we find the REFORMER who mends old suits and repairs walls of old buildings so that they do not collapse, the regressive type, the Revolutionary of blood and brandy, the leader of coups and coups d’état, the man with a rifle on his shoulder, the Dictator who enjoys taking to the firing squad all those who do not accept his whims, his theories.</p>\n<p>In the second type of Psychological Rebellion we find BUDDHA, JESUS, HERMES, the transformer, the INTELLIGENT REBEL, the INTUITIVE, the GREAT champions of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Those who only educate themselves with the absurd purpose of climbing magnificent positions within the bureaucratic hive, climbing, climbing to the top of the ladder, making themselves felt, etc., lack true depth, are Imbeciles by nature, superficial, hollow, one hundred percent rogues.</p>\n<p>It has already been proven ad nauseam that when true INTEGRATION of thought and feeling does not exist in the human being, even if we have received a great education, life is incomplete, contradictory, boring and tormented by innumerable fears of all kinds.</p>\n<p>Beyond all doubt and without fear of being wrong, we can emphatically affirm that without INTEGRAL education, life is harmful, useless and detrimental.</p>\n<p>THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL has an INTERNAL EGO unfortunately composed of distant ENTITIES that are strengthened by MISGUIDED EDUCATION.</p>\n<p>THE PLURALISED I that each of us carries within, is the fundamental cause of all our complexes and contradictions.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION must teach the new generations our Psychological DIDACTICS for the DISSOLUTION of the I.</p>\n<p>Only by dissolving the various entities that together constitute the Ego (I) can we establish in ourselves a permanent centre of individual consciousness, then we will be INTEGRAL.</p>\n<p>While the PLURALISED I exists within each of us, we will not only embitter life for ourselves but also for others.</p>\n<p>What good is it for us to study law and become lawyers, if we perpetuate lawsuits? What good is it to accumulate many knowledge in our mind, if we continue to be confused? What good are technical and industrial skills if we use them for the destruction of our fellow human beings?</p>\n<p>It is useless to instruct ourselves, attend classes, study, if in the process of daily living we are miserably destroying each other.</p>\n<p>The objective of education should not only be to produce new job seekers every year, a new type of rogues, new boors who do not even know how to respect the Religion of others, etc.</p>\n<p>The true objective of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION must be to create true INTEGRATED men and women and therefore conscious and intelligent.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities, all think, except to awaken the INTEGRAL INTELLIGENCE of the EDUCATEES.</p>\n<p>Anyone can covet and acquire titles, decorations, diplomas and even become very efficient in the mechanistic terrain of life, but this does not mean being INTELLIGENT.</p>\n<p>INTELLIGENCE can never be mere mechanical functionalism, INTELLIGENCE cannot be the result of simple bookish information, INTELLIGENCE is not the ability to react automatically with sparkling words to any challenge. INTELLIGENCE is not mere verbalisation of memory. INTELLIGENCE is the ability to directly receive the ESSENCE, the REAL, what truly IS.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is the science that allows us to awaken this ability in ourselves and in others.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION helps each INDIVIDUAL to discover the true VALUES that arise as a result of deep investigation and INTEGRAL COMPREHENSION of HIMSELF.</p>\n<p>When there is no SELF-KNOWLEDGE in us, then SELF-EXPRESSION becomes SELFISH AND DESTRUCTIVE SELF-AFFIRMATION.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is only concerned with awakening in each individual THE CAPACITY to understand himself in all terrains of the mind and not simply to indulge in the complacency of the misguided SELF-EXPRESSION of the PLURALISED I.</p>"
