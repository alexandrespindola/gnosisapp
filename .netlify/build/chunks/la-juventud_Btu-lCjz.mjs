    "set:html": "<p>Youth is divided into two periods of seven years each. The first period begins at 21 years of age and concludes at 28. The second period starts at 28 and ends at 35.</p>\n<p>The foundations of youth are found in the home, the school, and the street. Youth built on the foundation of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is in fact EDIFYING and essentially DIGNIFYING.</p>\n<p>Youth built on false foundations is, as a logical consequence, a wrong path.</p>\n<p>Most men spend the first part of their lives making the rest of it miserable.</p>\n<p>Young people, through a mistaken concept of false manhood, often fall into the arms of prostitutes.</p>\n<p>The excesses of youth are bills drawn against old age payable with very expensive interest thirty years from date.</p>\n<p>Without FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION, youth is a perpetual drunkenness: it is the fever of error, liquor, and animal passion.</p>\n<p>Everything that man is to be in his life is in a potential state during the first thirty years of existence.</p>\n<p>Of all the great human actions we know of, both in previous times and in our own, most of them have been initiated before the age of thirty.</p>\n<p>The man who has reached the age of thirty sometimes feels as if he is coming out of a great battle in which he has seen a multitude of companions fall one after another.</p>\n<p>At thirty, men and women have already lost all their vivacity and enthusiasm, and if they fail in their first endeavours, they become pessimistic and abandon the game.</p>\n<p>The illusions of maturity succeed the illusions of youth. Without Fundamental Education, the inheritance of old age is usually despair.</p>\n<p>Youth is fleeting. Beauty is the splendour of youth, but it is illusory, it does not last.</p>\n<p>Youth has a living Genius and a weak Judgement. Rare in life are young people with strong Judgement and living Genius.</p>\n<p>Without FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION young people are passionate, drunk, rogues, biting, lustful, lecherous, gluttonous, greedy, envious, jealous, bullies, thieves, proud, lazy, etc.</p>\n<p>Youth is a summer sun that soon hides. Young people love to waste the vital values of youth.</p>\n<p>The Old commit the error of exploiting the young and leading them to war.</p>\n<p>Young people can transform themselves and transform the World if they are guided by the path of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.</p>\n<p>In youth we are full of illusions that only lead us to disenchantment.</p>\n<p>The EGO takes advantage of the fire of youth to strengthen and become powerful.</p>\n<p>The Ego wants passionate satisfactions at any price, even if old age is totally disastrous.</p>\n<p>Young people are only interested in surrendering themselves to fornication, wine, and pleasures of all kinds.</p>\n<p>Young people do not want to realise that being slaves to pleasure is for harlots, but not for true men.</p>\n<p>No pleasure lasts long enough. The thirst for pleasures is the ailment that makes INTELLECTUAL ANIMALS most despicable. The great Spanish-speaking poet Jorge Manrique, said:</p>\n<p>“How quickly pleasure goes,\nhow after remembered,\nit gives pain,\nhow in our opinion\nany past time was better”</p>\n<p>Aristotle, speaking about pleasure, said: “When it comes to judging pleasure, we men are not impartial judges.”</p>\n<p>THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL enjoys justifying pleasure. Frederick the Great had no problem in emphatically stating: “PLEASURE IS THE MOST REAL GOOD OF THIS LIFE.”</p>\n<p>The most intolerable pain is that produced by the prolongation of the most intense pleasure.</p>\n<p>Young rakes abound like weeds. The rake EGO always justifies pleasure.</p>\n<p>The CHRONIC rake abhors Marriage or prefers to postpone it. It is a serious matter to postpone Marriage under the pretext of enjoying all the pleasures of the earth.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to end the vitality of youth and then get married; the victims of such stupidity are the children.</p>\n<p>Many men marry because they are tired, many women marry out of curiosity, and the result of such absurdities is always disappointment.</p>\n<p>Every wise man truly loves with all his heart the woman he has chosen.</p>\n<p>We must always marry in youth if we really do not want to have a miserable old age.</p>\n<p>There is time for everything in life. It is normal for a young person to get married, but it is stupid for an old person to get married.</p>\n<p>Young people should get married and know how to build their home. We must not forget that the monster of jealousy destroys homes.</p>\n<p>Solomon said: “Jealousy is cruel as the grave; its coals are coals of fire.”</p>\n<p>The race of INTELLECTUAL ANIMALS is jealous like dogs. Jealousy is totally ANIMAL.</p>\n<p>The man who is jealous of a woman does not know who he is dealing with. It is better not to be jealous of her in order to know what kind of woman we have.</p>\n<p>The venomous screaming of a jealous woman is more deadly than the fangs of a rabid dog.</p>\n<p>It is false to say that where there is jealousy there is love. Jealousy never arises from love; love and jealousy are incompatible. The origin of jealousy is in fear.</p>\n<p>The EGO justifies jealousy with reasons of many kinds. The EGO fears losing the loved one.</p>\n<p>Whoever truly wants to dissolve the EGO must always be willing to lose what is most loved.</p>\n<p>In practice, we have been able to demonstrate after many years of observation, that every libertine bachelor becomes a jealous husband.</p>\n<p>Every man has been terribly fornicating.</p>\n<p>Man and woman should be united voluntarily and by love, but not by fear and jealousy.</p>\n<p>Before the GREAT LAW, man must answer for his conduct and woman for hers. The husband cannot answer for the conduct of the woman, nor can the woman answer for the conduct of her husband. Let each one answer for their own conduct and let jealousy be dissolved.</p>\n<p>The basic problem of youth is Marriage.</p>\n<p>The flirtatious young woman with several boyfriends remains a spinster “because they are all disillusioned with her.”</p>\n<p>It is necessary for young women to know how to keep their boyfriend if they really want to get married.</p>\n<p>It is necessary not to confuse LOVE with PASSION. Young lovers and girls do not know how to distinguish between love and passion.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to know that PASSION is a poison that deceives the mind and the heart.</p>\n<p>Every passionate man and every passionate woman could even swear with tears of blood that they are truly in love.</p>\n<p>After the animal passion is satisfied, the house of cards falls to the ground.</p>\n<p>The failure of so many marriages is due to the fact that they married out of animal passion, but not out of LOVE.</p>\n<p>The most serious step we take during youth is Marriage, and in Schools, Colleges and Universities young people should be prepared for this important step.</p>\n<p>It is unfortunate that many young people marry for economic interest or mere social convenience.</p>\n<p>When Marriage is carried out by animal passion or by social convenience or economic interest, the result is failure.</p>\n<p>There are many couples who fail in marriage due to incompatibility of character.</p>\n<p>The woman who marries a jealous, angry, furious young man will become the victim of an executioner.</p>\n<p>The young man who marries a jealous, furious, angry woman, it is clear that he will have to spend his life in hell.</p>\n<p>For there to be true love between two beings, it is urgent that there is no animal passion, it is essential to dissolve the EGO of jealousy, it is necessary to disintegrate anger, an uninterest to all tests is basic.</p>\n<p>THE EGO damages homes, the MYSELF destroys harmony. If young people study our FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION and propose to dissolve the EGO, it is clear that they will be able to find the path of PERFECT MARRIAGE.</p>\n<p>Only by dissolving the EGO can there be true happiness in homes. To the young people who want to be happy in marriage, we prescribe studying our FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION in depth and dissolving the EGO.</p>\n<p>Many parents are terribly jealous of their daughters and do not want them to have a boyfriend. Such a procedure is absurd one hundred percent because the girls need to have a boyfriend and get married.</p>\n<p>The result of such a lack of understanding are secret boyfriends, on the street, with the ever-present danger of falling into the hands of the seductive gallant.</p>\n<p>Young women should always have freedom to have their boyfriend, but because they have not yet dissolved the EGO, it is advisable not to leave them alone with the boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Young people should have freedom to have their parties at home. Healthy distractions do not harm anyone and Youth needs to have distractions.</p>\n<p>What harms youth is liquor, cigarettes, fornication, orgies, debauchery, bars, cabarets, etc.</p>\n<p>Family parties, decent dances, good music, walks in the countryside, etc., cannot harm anyone.</p>\n<p>The mind damages love. Many young people have lost the opportunity to marry magnificent women due to their economic fears, to the memories of yesterday to the worries of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>The fear of life, of hunger, of misery, and the vain projects of the mind become the fundamental cause of all nuptial postponements.</p>\n<p>Many are the young people who propose not to marry until they possess a certain amount of money, their own house, a late-model car and a thousand other silly things as if all that were happiness.</p>\n<p>It is regrettable that that kind of men lose beautiful marriage opportunities because of fear of life, of death, of what they will say, etc.</p>\n<p>Such kind of men remain bachelors for their whole life or marry too late, when they no longer have time to raise a family and educate their children.</p>\n<p>Really all that a man needs to support his wife and children is to have a profession or a humble trade, that is all.</p>\n<p>Many young women remain spinsters for choosing a husband. Calculating, interested, selfish women remain spinsters or fail completely in marriage.</p>\n<p>It is necessary for girls to understand that every man is disillusioned with the interested, calculating and selfish woman.</p>\n<p>Some young women, eager to catch a husband, paint their faces in an exaggerated way, pluck their eyebrows, curl their hair, wear wigs and false eye bags, these women do not understand male psychology.</p>\n<p>The male by nature abhors painted dolls and admires totally natural beauty and the naive smile.</p>\n<p>The man wants to see in the woman sincerity, simplicity, true and disinterested love, the naivety of nature.</p>\n<p>Young women who want to get married need to understand the psychology of the male sex in depth.</p>\n<p>LOVE is the SUMMUM of wisdom. Love is fed with love. The fire of eternal youth is love.</p>"
