    "set:html": "<p>Through experience, we have seen that it is impossible to understand THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE until we have fully understood the complex problem of the MIND.</p>\n<p>Those who assume that the MIND is the BRAIN are completely mistaken. The MIND is ENERGETIC, subtle, it can become independent of MATTER, it can, in certain hypnotic states or during normal sleep, transport itself to very remote places to see and hear what is happening in those places.</p>\n<p>In PARAPSYCHOLOGY laboratories, remarkable experiments are carried out with subjects in a HYPNOTIC state.</p>\n<p>Many subjects in a HYPNOTIC state have been able to report in detail about events, people and situations that were happening at remote distances during their hypnotic trance.</p>\n<p>Scientists have been able to verify the reality of this INFORMATION after these experiments. They have been able to verify the reality of the facts, the accuracy of the EVENTS.</p>\n<p>With these experiments in PARAPSYCHOLOGY laboratories, it is fully demonstrated by observation and experience that the BRAIN is not the MIND.</p>\n<p>Truly and in all truth, we can say that the mind can travel through time and space, independently of the brain, to see and hear things that happen in distant places.</p>\n<p>The REALITY of EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTIONS is now ABSOLUTELY proven, and only a raving lunatic or an idiot could deny the reality of EXTRA PERCEPTIONS.</p>\n<p>The brain is made to elaborate thought but it is not thought. The brain is only the instrument of the MIND, it is not the mind.</p>\n<p>We need to study the mind in depth if we truly want to know in a COMPLETE way that which is called LOVE.</p>\n<p>Children and young people, male and female, have more elastic, ductile, quick, alert minds, etc.</p>\n<p>Many are the children and young people who enjoy asking their parents and teachers about such and such things, they want to know something more, they want to know and that is why they ask, observe, see certain details that adults despise or do not perceive.</p>\n<p>As the years go by, as we advance in age, the mind gradually crystallises.</p>\n<p>The mind of the elderly is fixed, petrified, it no longer changes even with cannons.</p>\n<p>The old are already like that and they die like that, they do not change, they approach everything from a fixed point.</p>\n<p>The “DOTAGE” of the elderly, their prejudices, fixed ideas, etc. all seem together like a ROCK, a STONE that does not change in any way. That is why the common saying goes “GENIUS AND FIGURE UNTIL THE GRAVE”.</p>\n<p>It is URGENT that teachers in charge of forming the PERSONALITY of students study the mind in depth, so that they can guide the new generations intelligently.</p>\n<p>It is painful to fully understand how the MIND gradually petrifies over time.</p>\n<p>The MIND is the killer of the REAL, of the true. The MIND destroys LOVE.</p>\n<p>Whoever gets old is no longer capable of LOVE because their mind is full of painful experiences, prejudices, fixed ideas like steel points, etc.</p>\n<p>There are some dirty old men out there who think they are still capable of LOVE, but what happens is that these old men are full of senile sexual passions and confuse PASSION with LOVE.</p>\n<p>Every “DIRTY OLD MAN” and “DIRTY OLD WOMAN” go through tremendous passionate lustful states before dying and they believe that this is LOVE.</p>\n<p>The LOVE of the old is impossible because the mind destroys it with its “DOTAGE” “FIXED IDEAS”, “PREJUDICES”, “JEALOUSY”, “EXPERIENCES”, “MEMORIES”, sexual passions, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The MIND is the worst enemy of LOVE. In SUPER-CIVILISED countries LOVE no longer exists because the minds of the people only smell of factories, bank accounts, petrol and celluloid.</p>\n<p>There are many bottles for the mind and each person’s mind is very well bottled.</p>\n<p>Some have the MIND bottled up in ABOMINABLE COMMUNISM, others have it bottled up in ruthless CAPITALISM.</p>\n<p>There are those who have the MIND BOTTLED up in jealousy, in hatred, in the desire to be rich, in good social standing, in pessimism, in attachment to certain people, in attachment to their own sufferings, in their family problems, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>People love to bottle up the MIND. Rare are those who truly resolve to break the bottle to pieces.</p>\n<p>We need to FREE THE MIND, but people like slavery, it is very rare to find someone in life who does not have their MIND well bottled up.</p>\n<p>Teachers should teach their students all these things. They should teach the new generations to investigate their own minds, to observe them, to understand them, only in this way through deep UNDERSTANDING can we prevent the mind from crystallising, freezing, bottling up.</p>\n<p>The only thing that can transform the world is that which is called LOVE, but the mind destroys LOVE.</p>\n<p>We need to STUDY our own mind, observe it, investigate it deeply, understand it truly. Only in this way, only by becoming masters of ourselves, of our own mind, will we kill the killer of LOVE and be truly happy.</p>\n<p>Those who live fantasising beautifully about LOVE, those who live making projects about LOVE, those who want LOVE to operate according to their likes and dislikes, projects and fantasies, norms and prejudices, memories and experiences, etc. will never really know what LOVE is, in fact they have become enemies of LOVE.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to understand in a COMPLETE way what the processes of the mind are in a state of accumulation of experiences.</p>\n<p>The teacher often scolds justly but sometimes stupidly and without real reason, without understanding that every unjust scolding is deposited in the minds of the students, the result of such a mistaken procedure is usually the loss of LOVE for the TEACHER.</p>\n<p>The MIND destroys LOVE and this is something that TEACHERS of schools, colleges and universities should never forget.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to understand in depth all those mental processes that end the beauty of LOVE.</p>\n<p>It is not enough to be a father or mother, you have to know how to LOVE. Fathers and mothers believe that they love their sons and daughters because they have them, because they are theirs, because they possess them, like someone who has a bicycle, a car, a house.</p>\n<p>That sense of possession of dependence is often confused with LOVE but it could never be LOVE.</p>\n<p>The teachers of our second home, which is school, believe that they love their disciples because they belong to them as such, because they possess them, but that is not LOVE. The sense of possession or dependence IS NOT LOVE.</p>\n<p>The MIND destroys LOVE and only by understanding all the mistaken functionalisms of the mind, our absurd way of thinking, our bad habits, automatic, mechanist habits, mistaken way of seeing things, etc. can we come to experience, to truly experience that which does not belong to time, that which is called LOVE.</p>\n<p>Those who want LOVE to become a piece of their own routine machine, those who want LOVE to walk along the mistaken tracks of their own prejudices, appetites, fears, experiences of life, selfish way of seeing things, mistaken way of thinking, etc. end up in fact with LOVE because it never lets itself be submitted.</p>\n<p>Those who want LOVE to function as I WANT, as I DESIRE, as I THINK, lose LOVE because CUPID, the GOD of LOVE, is never willing to be enslaved by the I.</p>\n<p>We must end the I, with the MYSELF, with the SELF so as not to lose the child of LOVE.</p>\n<p>The I is a bundle of memories, appetites, fears, hatreds, passions, experiences, selfishness, envy, greed, lust, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Only by understanding each defect separately; only by studying it, observing it directly not only in the intellectual region, but also at all subconscious levels of the mind, does each defect disappear, we are dying from moment to moment. Thus and only thus do we achieve the disintegration of the I.</p>\n<p>Those who want to bottle LOVE inside the horrible bottle of the I, lose LOVE, they are left without it, because LOVE can never be bottled.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately people want LOVE to behave according to their own habits, desires, customs, etc., people want LOVE to submit to the I and that is completely impossible because LOVE does not obey the I.</p>\n<p>Couples in love, or better said passionate, suppose that LOVE should march faithfully along the tracks of their own desires, concupiscences, errors, etc., and in this they are totally mistaken.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about the two of us! say those in love or sexually passionate, which is what abounds most in this World, and then come the talks, the projects, the yearnings and sighs. Each one says something, exposes their projects, their desires, their way of seeing things in life and wants LOVE to move like a railway machine along the steel tracks traced by the mind.</p>\n<p>How wrong are those Lovers or passionate people! How far they are from reality.</p>\n<p>LOVE does not obey the I and when the spouses want to put chains around its neck and submit it, it flees leaving the couple in disgrace.</p>\n<p>The MIND has the bad taste of comparing. The man compares one girlfriend with another. The woman compares one man with another. The Teacher compares one student with another, one female student with another as if all their students did not deserve the same appreciation. Really all comparison is ABOMINABLE.</p>\n<p>Whoever contemplates a beautiful sunset and compares it with another, does not really know how to understand the beauty that is before their eyes.</p>\n<p>Whoever contemplates a beautiful mountain and compares it with another that they saw yesterday, is not really understanding the beauty of the mountain that is before their eyes.</p>\n<p>Where COMPARISON exists, TRUE LOVE does not exist. The Father and Mother who truly love their children, never compare them with anyone, they love them and that is all.</p>\n<p>The husband who really loves his wife, never makes the mistake of comparing her with anyone, he loves her and that is all.</p>\n<p>The TEACHER who loves their students never discriminate against them, never compare them with each other, they truly love them and that is all.</p>\n<p>The Mind Divided by comparisons, the mind enslaved by DUALISM, destroys LOVE.</p>\n<p>The Mind divided by the battle of opposites is not capable of understanding the new, it petrifies, it freezes.</p>\n<p>The MIND HAS MANY DEPTHS, Regions, subconscious terrains, nooks and crannies, but the best is the ESSENCE, the CONSCIOUSNESS and it is in the Centre.</p>\n<p>When DUALISM ends, when the mind becomes COMPLETE, SERENE, QUIET, PROFOUND, when it no longer compares, then the ESSENCE, the CONSCIOUSNESS awakens and that should be the true objective of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.</p>\n<p>Let us distinguish between OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE. In the OBJECTIVE there is awake consciousness. In the SUBJECTIVE there is asleep Consciousness, SUBCONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>Only OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS can enjoy OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.</p>\n<p>The intellectual information that Students of all Schools, Colleges and Universities currently receive, is one hundred percent SUBJECTIVE.</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE cannot be acquired without OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>Students must first reach SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and then OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>Only by the PATH OF LOVE can we reach OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS and OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to understand the COMPLEX PROBLEM OF THE MIND if we truly want to travel the PATH OF LOVE.</p>"
