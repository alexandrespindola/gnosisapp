To remain silent on the sexual problem is a crime. To speak incorrectly about the sexual problem also constitutes another crime.</p>\n<p>If parents and teachers remain silent, sexual perverts speak, and the victims become inexperienced adolescents.</p>\n<p>If the adolescent cannot consult parents or teachers, they will then consult their schoolmates, possibly already deviated along the wrong path. The result is not long in coming and the new adolescent, following false advice, will give themselves to the vice of masturbation or deviate along the path of homosexuality.</p>\n<p>The vice of masturbation completely ruins brain power. It is necessary to know that there is an intimate relationship between the semen and the brain. It is necessary to cerebrialise the semen. It is necessary to seminise the brain.</p>\n<p>The brain is seminised by transmuting sexual energy, sublimating it, converting it into brain power.</p>\n<p>In this way, the semen remains cerebrialised and the brain seminised.</p>\n<p>Gnostic science studies endocrinology in depth and teaches methods and systems to transmute sexual energies, but this is a matter that does not fit within this book.</p>\n<p>If the reader wants information on Gnosticism, they should study our Gnostic books and enter our studies.</p>\n<p>Adolescents should sublimate sexual energies by cultivating the aesthetic sense, learning music, sculpture, painting, taking excursions to the high mountains, etc.</p>\n<p>How many faces that could have been beautiful wither!</p>\n<p>How many brains degenerate! All for lack of a warning cry at the opportune moment.</p>\n<p>The vice of masturbation, both in young men and young women, has become more common than washing hands.</p>\n<p>The insane asylums are full of men and women who ruined their brains in the disgusting vice of masturbation. The destiny of masturbators is the insane asylum.</p>\n<p>The vice of homosexuality has rotten the roots of this decadent and perverse race.</p>\n<p>It seems incredible that in countries like England that pride themselves on being cultured and super-civilised, cinemas exist freely where homosexual films are shown.</p>\n<p>It seems incredible that it is precisely in England where efforts are already being made to officially legalise homosexual marriages.</p>\n<p>In the great metropolises of the world there are currently brothels and homosexual clubs.</p>\n<p>The dark brotherhood of the enemies of women today has perverted organisations that amaze with their degenerate fraternity.</p>\n<p>Many readers may be too surprised by this “degenerate fraternity” but we must not forget that in all times of history there have always been various brotherhoods of crime.</p>\n<p>The morbid brotherhood of the enemies of women is, without a doubt, a brotherhood of crime.</p>\n<p>The enemies of women always or almost always occupy the key positions within the bureaucratic hive.</p>\n<p>When a homosexual goes to jail, he is soon released due to the opportune influence of the key men of the crime brotherhood.</p>\n<p>If an effeminate man falls into disgrace, he soon receives financial aid from all the sinister characters of the Brotherhood of crime.</p>\n<p>The dark members of homosexuality recognise each other by the uniform they wear.</p>\n<p>It is astonishing to know that queers wear a uniform, but it is so. The uniform of homosexuals corresponds to every fashion that begins. Queers start every new fashion. When a fashion becomes common, then they start another. In this way the uniform of the crime brotherhood is always new.</p>\n<p>All the great cities of the world today have millions of homosexuals.</p>\n<p>The vice of homosexuality begins its shameful march during adolescence.</p>\n<p>Many schools for adolescent boys and young women are true homosexual brothels.</p>\n<p>Millions of young women adolescents march resolutely along the dark path of the enemies of man.</p>\n<p>Millions of female adolescents are homosexual. The crime brotherhood among female homosexuals is as strong as the crime brotherhood among the male sex.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to abandon radically and definitively the false modesty and to point out to adolescents of both sexes, frankly, all the sexual mysteries.</p>\n<p>Only in this way can the new generations be guided along the path of REGENERATION.</p>"
