The henchmen of such Schools sleep very deeply in a practically infraconscious and unconscious state.</p>\n<p>Those who confuse consciousness with psychological functions; thoughts, feelings, motor impulses and sensations, are really very unconscious, they sleep deeply.</p>\n<p>Those who admit the existence of CONSCIOUSNESS but flatly deny the different conscious grades, accuse lack of conscious experience, sleep of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has ever awakened momentarily knows very well from their own experience that there are different degrees of consciousness observable in oneself.</p>\n<p>First Time. How long did we remain conscious?</p>\n<p>Second Frequency. how many times have we awakened consciousness?</p>\n<p>Third. AMPLITUDE AND PENETRATION. Of what will you be conscious?</p>\n<p>REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY and the ancient PHILOKALIA affirm that through great SUPER-EFFORTS of a very special type one can awaken consciousness and make it continuous and controllable.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION aims to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS. Ten or fifteen years of studies in school, college and university are of no use if, when leaving the classrooms, we are sleeping automatons.</p>\n<p>It is no exaggeration to affirm that through some great EFFORT the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL can be conscious of itself for only a couple of minutes.</p>\n<p>It is clear that in this there are usually rare exceptions today that we have to look for with Diogenesâ€™ lantern, these rare cases are represented by the TRUE MEN, BUDDHA, JESUS, HERMES, QUETZACOATL, etc.</p>\n<p>These founders of RELIGIONS possessed CONTINUOUS CONSCIOUSNESS, they were great ILLUMINATED ones.</p>\n<p>Normally people are NOT conscious of themselves. The illusion of being continuously conscious is born of memory and all thought processes.</p>\n<p>The man who practices a retrospective exercise to remember his whole life, can truly remember, recall how many times he was married, how many children he fathered, who his parents were, his Teachers, etc., but this does not mean awakening consciousness, this is simply remembering unconscious acts and that is all.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to repeat what we have already said in previous chapters. There are four states of CONSCIOUSNESS. These are: SLEEP, state of WAKEFULNESS, SELF-Consciousness and OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called MAN, only lives in two of these states. One part of his life passes in sleep and the other in the misnamed STATE OF WAKEFULNESS, which is also sleep.</p>\n<p>The man who sleeps and is dreaming, believes that he wakes up by returning to the state of wakefulness, but in reality during this state of wakefulness he continues to dream.</p>\n<p>This is similar to dawn, the stars are hidden due to sunlight but they continue to exist even if the physical eyes do not perceive them.</p>\n<p>In normal, common life, the human being knows nothing of SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and much less of OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>However, people are proud and everyone believes themselves to be SELF-CONSCIOUS; the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL firmly believes that it has consciousness of itself and in no way will it accept being told that it is asleep and that it lives unconscious of itself.</p>\n<p>There are exceptional moments when the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL awakens, but those moments are very rare, they can be represented in an instant of supreme danger, during an intense emotion, in some new circumstance, in some new unexpected situation, etc.</p>\n<p>It is truly a disgrace that the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL has no control over these fleeting states of consciousness, that it cannot evoke them, that it cannot make them continuous.</p>\n<p>However, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION affirms that man can ACHIEVE control of CONSCIOUSNESS and acquire SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY has scientific methods and procedures to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>If we want to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS we need to start by examining, studying and then eliminating all the obstacles that come our way, in this book we have taught the way to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS starting from the very benches of the School.</p>"
