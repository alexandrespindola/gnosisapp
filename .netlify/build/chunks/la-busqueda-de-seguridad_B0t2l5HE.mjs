The HITLERIANS said that this MAXIM was of GOLD.</p>\n<p>Now the friend fears the friend and even uses MAXIMS to protect himself. There is no longer sincerity between friends. Fear and the search for security ended the delicious fragrance of sincerity.</p>\n<p>Castro Rus in Cuba has shot thousands of citizens fearing that they will finish him off; Castro seeks security by shooting. He believes that this is how he can find Security.</p>\n<p>Stalin, the perverse and bloody Stalin, stank up Russia with his bloody purges. That was the way to seek his security.</p>\n<p>Hitler organised the Gestapo, the terrible Gestapo, for the security of the State. There is no doubt that he feared being overthrown and that is why he founded the bloody Gestapo.</p>\n<p>All the bitterness of this world originates in fear and the search for security.</p>\n<p>School teachers should teach students the virtue of courage.</p>\n<p>It is lamentable that children are filled with fear from their own homes.</p>\n<p>Children are threatened, intimidated, frightened, beaten, etc.</p>\n<p>It is customary for parents and teachers to frighten children and young people in order to get them to study.</p>\n<p>Usually children and young people are told that if they do not study they will have to beg, wander hungry through the streets, perform very humble jobs such as cleaning shoes, carrying bundles, selling newspapers, working in the plough, etc. etc. etc. (As if work were a crime)</p>\n<p>Deep down, behind all these words of parents and teachers, there is fear for the child and a search for security for the child.</p>\n<p>The serious thing about everything we are saying is that children and young people become self-conscious, filled with fear and later in practical life they are subjects full of fear.</p>\n<p>Parents and teachers who have the bad taste to frighten children, young people, unconsciously are leading them along the path of crime, because as we have already said, every crime has its origin in fear and the search for security.</p>\n<p>Today, FEAR and the SEARCH FOR SECURITY have turned planet Earth into a frightening hell. Everyone fears. Everyone wants security.</p>\n<p>In other times one could travel freely, now the borders are full of armed guards, passports and certificates of all kinds are required to have the right to pass from one country to another.</p>\n<p>All this is the result of fear and the SEARCH FOR SECURITY. They fear the traveller, they fear the newcomer and they seek security in passports and papers of all kinds.</p>\n<p>School teachers, colleges, universities should understand the horror of all this and cooperate for the good of the world, knowing how to educate the new generations, teaching them the way of authentic courage.</p>\n<p>It is URGENT to teach the new generations not to fear and not to seek security in anything or anyone.</p>\n<p>It is essential that every individual learn to trust more in himself.</p>\n<p>FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY are terrible weaknesses that turned life into a frightening HELL.</p>\n<p>Cowards, fearful people, weak people who are always looking for SECURITY abound everywhere.</p>\n<p>They fear life, they fear death, they fear what they will say, “what they say that they say”, losing social position, political position, prestige, money, the beautiful house, the beautiful woman, the good husband, the employment, the business, the monopoly, the furniture, the car, etc. etc. etc. everything is feared, cowards, fearful people, weak people abound everywhere, but no one believes himself to be a coward, everyone presumes to be strong, courageous, etc.</p>\n<p>In all social classes there are thousands and millions of interests that they fear losing and therefore everyone seeks securities that, by becoming more and more complex, in fact make life more and more complicated, more and more difficult, more and more bitter, cruel and ruthless.</p>\n<p>All murmuring, all slander, intrigue, etc., originate in fear and the search for security.</p>\n<p>In order not to lose fortune, position, power, prestige, slanders, gossip are spread, they murder, they pay for murder in secret, etc.</p>\n<p>The powerful of the earth even indulge in having assassins for hire and very well paid, with the disgusting purpose of eliminating anyone who threatens to eclipse them.</p>\n<p>They love power for power itself and secure it on the basis of money and a lot of blood.</p>\n<p>Newspapers are constantly giving news of many cases of suicide.</p>\n<p>Many believe that the person who commits suicide is courageous but really the person who commits suicide is a coward who is afraid of life and who seeks security in the gaunt arms of death.</p>\n<p>Some war heroes were known as weak and cowardly people, but when they came face to face with death, their terror was so frightening that they turned into terrible beasts seeking security for their lives, making a supreme effort against death. Then they were declared HEROES.</p>\n<p>Fear is often confused with courage. The person who commits suicide seems very courageous, the person who carries a pistol seems very courageous, but in reality the suicidal and the gunmen are very cowardly.</p>\n<p>The person who is not afraid of life does not commit suicide. The person who is not afraid of anyone does not carry a pistol on his belt.</p>\n<p>It is URGENT that school teachers teach the citizen clearly and precisely what TRUE VALUE is and what fear is.</p>\n<p>FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY have turned the world into a frightening hell.</p>"
