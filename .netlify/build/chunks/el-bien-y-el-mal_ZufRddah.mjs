    "set:html": "<p>Good and evil do not exist. Something is good when it suits us, and bad when it doesn’t. Good and evil are a matter of selfish convenience and whims of the mind.</p>\n<p>The man who invented the fateful terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’ was an Atlantean named Makari Kronvernkzyon, a distinguished member of the Akaldan Scientific Society, located on the submerged continent of Atlantis.</p>\n<p>The old, wise Archaic man never suspected the grave damage he was going to cause humanity with the invention of his two little words.</p>\n<p>The wise Atlanteans deeply studied all the evolutionary, involutive and neutral forces of nature, but this old sage came up with the idea of defining the first two with the terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’. He called the evolutionary-type forces ‘good’ and baptised the involutive-type forces with the term ‘evil’. He gave the neutral forces no name.</p>\n<p>These forces are processed within man and within nature, with the neutral force being the point of support and balance.</p>\n<p>Many centuries after the sinking of Atlantis with its famous Poseidonis, of which Plato speaks in his Republic, there existed in the oriental civilisation of Tiklyamishayana a very ancient priest who committed the very serious error of abusing the terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’, using them clumsily to base a morality upon them. The name of that priest was Armanatoora.</p>\n<p>With the passage of history through the innumerable centuries, humanity became corrupted with these two little words and converted them into the foundation of all their moral codes. Nowadays, one finds these two little words everywhere.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are many reformers who want moral restoration, but unfortunately for them and for this afflicted world, their minds are bottled up between ‘good’ and ‘evil’.</p>\n<p>All morality is founded on the little words ‘good’ and ‘evil’, therefore every moral reformer is in fact a reactionary.</p>\n<p>The terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’ always serve to justify or condemn our own errors.</p>\n<p>He who justifies or condemns does not understand. It is intelligent to understand the development of evolutionary forces, but it is not intelligent to justify them with the term ‘good’. It is intelligent to understand the processes of involutive forces, but it is stupid to condemn them with the term ‘evil’.</p>\n<p>Every centrifugal force can become a centripetal force. Every involutive force can be transformed into an evolutionary one.</p>\n<p>Within the infinite processes of energy in an evolutionary state, there exist infinite processes of energy in an involutive state.</p>\n<p>Within each human being, there exist different types of energy that evolve, devolve, and transform incessantly.</p>\n<p>To justify a certain type of energy and condemn another is not to understand. What is vital is to understand.</p>\n<p>The experience of truth has been very rare among humanity due to the concrete fact of mental bottling. People are bottled up between the opposites ‘good’ and ‘evil’.</p>\n<p>The revolutionary psychology of the Gnostic Movement is based on the study of the different types of energy that operate within the human organism and within nature.</p>\n<p>The Gnostic Movement has a revolutionary ethic that has nothing to do with the morality of the reactionaries, nor with the conservative and retardative terms of ‘good’ and ‘evil’.</p>\n<p>Within the psycho-physiological laboratory of the human organism, there exist evolutionary, involutive and neutral forces that must be studied and understood deeply.</p>\n<p>The term ‘good’ impedes the comprehension of evolutionary energies due to justification.</p>\n<p>The term ‘evil’ impedes the comprehension of involutive forces due to condemnation.</p>\n<p>To justify or condemn does not mean to understand. Whoever wants to end their defects must not justify them nor condemn them. It is urgent to understand our errors.</p>\n<p>Understanding anger at all levels of the mind is fundamental for serenity and sweetness to be born in us.</p>\n<p>Understanding the infinite nuances of greed is indispensable for philanthropy and altruism to be born in us.</p>\n<p>Understanding lust at all levels of the mind is an indispensable condition for true chastity to be born in us.</p>\n<p>Understanding envy in all areas of the mind is sufficient for a sense of cooperation and joy for the well-being and progress of others to be born in us.</p>\n<p>Understanding pride in all its nuances and degrees is the basis for the exotic flower of humility to be born in us in a natural and simple way.</p>\n<p>Understanding what that element of inertia called laziness is, not only in its grotesque forms but also in its most subtle forms, is indispensable for a sense of activity to be born in us.</p>\n<p>Understanding the various forms of gluttony and greed is equivalent to destroying the vices of the instinctive centre such as banquets, drunkenness, hunting, carnivorism, fear of death, desires to perpetuate the ego, fear of annihilation, etc.</p>\n<p>Teachers in schools, colleges and universities advise their pupils to improve as if the ego could improve, to acquire certain virtues as if the ego could achieve virtues, etc.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to understand that the ego never improves, that it is never more perfect, and that whoever covets virtues strengthens the ego.</p>\n<p>Total perfection is only born in us with the dissolution of the ego. Virtues are born in us in a natural and simple way when we understand our psychological defects not only on the intellectual level but also in all the subconscious and unconscious areas of the mind.</p>\n<p>Wanting to improve is stupid, desiring holiness is envy, coveting virtues means strengthening the ego with the poison of greed.</p>\n<p>We need the total death of the ego not only on the intellectual level but also in all the nooks, regions, areas and corridors of the mind. When we have died absolutely, only that which is perfect remains in us. That which is saturated with virtues, that which is the essence of our intimate being, that which is not of time.</p>\n<p>Only by deeply understanding all the infinite processes of the evolutionary forces that develop within ourselves here and now. Only by comprehensively understanding the different aspects of the involutive forces that are processed within ourselves from moment to moment, can we dissolve the ego.</p>\n<p>The terms ‘good’ and ‘evil’ serve to justify and condemn, but never to understand.</p>\n<p>Each defect has many nuances, backgrounds, subtexts and depths. To understand a defect on the intellectual level does not mean having understood it in the different subconscious, unconscious and infraconscious areas of the mind.</p>\n<p>Any defect may disappear from the intellectual level and continue in the other areas of the mind.</p>\n<p>Anger disguises itself with the toga of the Judge. Many covet not being greedy, there are those who do not covet money but covet psychic powers, virtues, loves, happiness here or after death, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Many men and women are moved and fascinated by people of the opposite sex, “supposedly” because they love beauty, their own subconscious betrays them, lust disguises itself with the aesthetic sense.</p>\n<p>Many envious people envy the saints and do penance and whip themselves because they also want to become saints.</p>\n<p>Many envious people envy those who sacrifice themselves for humanity and then, wanting to be great too, make a mockery of those they envy and launch all their defamatory slime against them.</p>\n<p>There are those who feel proud of their position, money, fame and prestige, and there are those who feel proud of their humble condition.</p>\n<p>Diogenes felt proud of the barrel in which he slept, and when he arrived at Socrates’ house he greeted him saying: “Trampling on your pride Socrates, trampling on your pride.” “Yes, Diogenes, with your pride you trample on my pride,” was Socrates’ response.</p>\n<p>Vain women curl their hair, dress and adorn themselves with everything they can to awaken the envy of other women, but vanity also disguises itself with the tunic of humility.</p>\n<p>Tradition tells that Aristippus, the Greek philosopher, wanting to demonstrate to the whole world his wisdom and humility, dressed in a very old and full of holes tunic, took in his right hand the staff of Philosophy and went through the streets of Athens. When Socrates saw him coming, he exclaimed: “Your vanity is seen through the holes of your garment, oh Aristippus.”</p>\n<p>Many are those who are in misery due to the element of laziness, but there are people who work too hard to earn a living but feel lazy to study and know themselves in order to dissolve the ego.</p>\n<p>Many are those who have abandoned gluttony, but unfortunately they get drunk and go hunting.</p>\n<p>Each defect is multifaceted and develops and processes gradually from the lowest rung of the psychological scale to the highest rung.</p>\n<p>Within the delightful cadence of a verse, the crime is also hidden.</p>\n<p>The crime also dresses as a Saint, as a Martyr, as chaste, as an Apostle, etc.</p>\n<p>Good and evil do not exist, these terms only serve to seek evasions and avoid the deep and detailed study of our own defects.</p>"
