    "set:html": "<p>The revolutionary psychology of the new era states that the organic machine of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL falsely called man, exists in a tri-centred or tri-cerebral form.</p>\n<p>The first brain is enclosed in the cranial box. The second brain corresponds specifically to the spinal column with its central medulla and all its nerve branches. The third brain does not reside in a defined place nor is it a specific organ. Really, the third brain is made up of the sympathetic nerve plexuses and in general by all the specific nerve centres of the human organism.</p>\n<p>The first brain is the thinking centre. The second brain is the centre of movement, commonly called the motor centre. The third brain is the emotional centre.</p>\n<p>It is completely demonstrated in practice that all abuse of the thinking brain produces excessive expenditure of intellectual energy. It is therefore logical to affirm without fear of doubt that asylums are true cemeteries of intellectual dead.</p>\n<p>Harmonious and balanced sports are useful for the motor brain, but the abuse of sport means excessive expenditure of motor energies and the result is usually disastrous. It is not absurd to affirm that there are dead of the motor brain. These dead are known as patients with Hemiplegia, Paraplegia, Progressive paralysis, etc.</p>\n<p>The aesthetic sense, mysticism, ecstasy, superior music, are necessary to cultivate the emotional centre, but the abuse of said brain produces useless wear and tear and waste of emotional energies. The emotional brain is abused by the existentialists of the “new wave”, the fanatics of Rock, the Pseudo-Sensual Artists of modern art, the morbid passionaries of sensuality, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Even though it may seem incredible, death certainly processes in thirds in each person. It is already proven to satiety that every disease has its base in any of the three brains.</p>\n<p>The great law has wisely deposited in each of the three brains of the intellectual animal, a certain capital of VITAL VALUES. Saving said capital means in fact lengthening life, wasting said capital produces death.</p>\n<p>Archaic traditions that have come down to us from the terrifying night of the centuries, affirm that the average of human life in the Ancient Continent MU, located in the Pacific Ocean, oscillated between Twelve and Fifteen Centuries.</p>\n<p>With the passage of the centuries through all the ages the mistaken use of the three brains was shortening life little by little.</p>\n<p>In the sun-kissed country of KEM… there in the old Egypt of the Pharaohs the average of human life already only reached one hundred and forty years.</p>\n<p>Currently in these modern times of petrol and celluloid, in this epoch of existentialism and Rock rebels, the average of human life according to some insurance companies, is barely fifty years.</p>\n<p>The Marxist-Leninist Gentlemen of the SOVIET UNION, braggarts and liars as always, are going around saying that they have invented very special serums to lengthen life but old man Kruschev is not yet eighty years old and has to ask permission from one foot to lift the other.</p>\n<p>In the centre of ASIA there exists a religious community constituted by elders who no longer even remember their youth. The average life of those elders oscillates between four hundred and five hundred years.</p>\n<p>The whole secret of long life of these Asian Monks consists in the wise use of the three brains.</p>\n<p>The balanced and harmonious functionalism of the three brains means saving of the VITAL VALUES and as a logical sequence, prolongation of life.</p>\n<p>There exists a cosmic Law known as “EQUALISATION OF THE VIBRATIONS OF MANY SOURCES”. The Monks of said Monastery know how to use said law by means of the use of the three brains.</p>\n<p>Extemporaneous pedagogy leads students to the abuse of the thinking brain whose results are already known by Psychiatry.</p>\n<p>The intelligent cultivation of the three brains is FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION. In the ancient schools of mysteries of Babylon, Greece, India, Persia, Egypt, etc., the students received complete direct information, for their three brains by means of the precept, the dance, the music, etc., intelligently combined.</p>\n<p>The theatres of ancient times formed part of the school. The drama, the comedy, the tragedy, combined with the special mime, the music, the oral teaching, etc. Served to inform the three brains of each individual.</p>\n<p>Then the students did not abuse the thinking brain and knew how to use their three brains intelligently and in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>The dances of the mysteries of Eleusis in Greece, the theatre in Babylon, the sculpture in Greece were always used to transmit knowledge to the disciples.</p>\n<p>Now in these degenerate times of Rock, the confused and disoriented students are walking along the dark path of mental abuse.</p>\n<p>Currently there are no true creative systems for the harmonious cultivation of the three brains.</p>\n<p>The teachers of schools, colleges and universities, only address the unfaithful memory of the bored students who anxiously await the hour to leave the classroom.</p>\n<p>It is urgent, it is indispensable to know how to combine intellect, movement and emotion with the purpose of bringing complete information to the three brains of the students.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to inform only one brain. The first brain is not the only one of cognition. It is criminal to abuse the thinking brain of the students.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION should lead the students along the path of harmonious development.</p>\n<p>Revolutionary psychology teaches clearly that the three brains have three kinds of independent associations totally different. These three kinds of associations evoke different types of impulses of the being.</p>\n<p>This gives us in fact three different personalities that possess nothing in common neither in their nature nor in their manifestations.</p>\n<p>The revolutionary psychology of the new era teaches that in each person there exist three distinct psychological aspects. With one part of the psychic essence we desire one thing, with another part we desire something decidedly different and thanks to the third part we do something totally opposite.</p>\n<p>In an instant of supreme pain, perhaps the loss of a loved one or any other intimate catastrophe, the emotional personality reaches despair while the intellectual personality asks itself the why of all that tragedy and the personality of movement only wants to flee the scene.</p>\n<p>These three distinct different and many times even contradictory personalities must be intelligently cultivated and instructed with methods and special systems in all the schools, colleges and universities.</p>\n<p>From the psychological point of view it is absurd to educate exclusively the intellectual personality. Man has three personalities that urgently need FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.</p>"
