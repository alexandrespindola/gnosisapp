    "set:html": "<p>Remembering is trying to store in the mind what we have seen and heard, what we have read, what other people have told us, what has happened to us, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Teachers want their students to store in their memory their words, their sentences, what is written in textbooks, entire chapters, overwhelming tasks, with all their full stops and commas, etc.</p>\n<p>Passing exams means recalling what we have been told, what we have read mechanically, verbalising memory, repeating like parrots, everything we have stored in our memory.</p>\n<p>It is necessary for the new generation to understand that repeating like a record player all the recordings made in the memory does not mean having understood thoroughly. Remembering is not understanding; it is useless to remember without understanding. The memory belongs to the past; it is something dead, something that no longer has life.</p>\n<p>It is indispensable, urgent and vitally important that all students in schools and universities really understand the deep meaning of profound comprehension.</p>\n<p>COMPREHENDING is something immediate, direct, something we experience intensely, something we experience very deeply and which inevitably becomes the true intimate SPRING of conscious action.</p>\n<p>Remembering, recalling is something dead, it belongs to the past and unfortunately becomes an ideal, a motto, an idea, an idealism that we want to imitate mechanically and follow unconsciously.</p>\n<p>In TRUE COMPREHENSION, in profound understanding, in intimate in-depth understanding there is only intimate pressure of consciousness, constant pressure born of the essence we carry within, and that is all.</p>\n<p>Authentic comprehension manifests as spontaneous, natural, simple action, free from the depressing process of choice; pure without indecision of any kind. COMPREHENSION converted into the SECRET SPRING of action is formidable, wonderful, edifying and essentially dignifying.</p>\n<p>Action based on the recollection of what we have read, of the ideal to which we aspire, of the rule of conduct that we have been taught, of the experiences accumulated in memory, etc., is calculating, depends on the depressing option, is dualistic, is based on conceptual choice and only leads inevitably to error and pain.</p>\n<p>That thing of accommodating action to recollection, that thing of trying to modify action to coincide with the memories accumulated in the memory, is something artificial, absurd without spontaneity and that inevitably can only lead us to error and pain.</p>\n<p>That thing of passing exams, that thing of passing the year, is done by any fool who has a good dose of cunning and memory.</p>\n<p>Understanding the subjects that have been studied and in which we are going to be examined is something very different, it has nothing to do with memory, it belongs to true intelligence which should not be confused with intellectualism.</p>\n<p>Those people who want to base all the acts of their life on the ideals, theories and memories of all kinds accumulated in the warehouses of the memory, are always going from comparison to comparison and where there is comparison there is also envy. These people compare themselves, their families, their children with the children of the neighbour, with the neighbouring people. They compare their house, their furniture, their clothes, all their things, with the things of the neighbour or of the neighbours or of their fellow man. They compare their ideas, the intelligence of their children with the ideas of other people, with the intelligence of other people and envy comes which then becomes the secret spring of action.</p>\n<p>To the misfortune of the world, the whole mechanism of society is based on envy and the acquisitive spirit. Everyone envies everyone. We envy ideas, things, people and we want to acquire money and more money, new theories, new ideas that we accumulate in the memory, new things to dazzle our fellow human beings, etc.</p>\n<p>In TRUE, legitimate, authentic COMPREHENSION there is true love and not mere verbalisation of memory.</p>\n<p>The things that are remembered, that which is entrusted to memory, soon falls into oblivion because memory is unfaithful. Students deposit in the warehouses of memory, ideals, theories, complete texts that are useless in practical life because they eventually disappear from memory without leaving any trace.</p>\n<p>People who only live reading and reading mechanically, people who enjoy storing theories among the warehouses of memory destroy the mind, they damage it miserably.</p>\n<p>We do not pronounce ourselves against true, deep and conscious study based on deep understanding. We only condemn the antiquated methods of extemporaneous pedagogy. We condemn every mechanical system of study, all memorisation, etc. Remembrance is superfluous where true understanding exists.</p>\n<p>We need to study, useful books are needed, school teachers, colleges, universities are needed. The GURU, the spiritual guides, mahatmas, etc. are needed, but it is necessary to understand the teachings in an integral way and not merely deposit them among the warehouses of the unfaithful memory.</p>\n<p>We can never be truly free while we have the bad taste to be comparing ourselves with the memory accumulated in the memory, with the ideal, with what we aspire to become and are not, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>When we truly understand the teachings received, we do not need to remember them in memory, nor convert them into ideals.</p>\n<p>Where there is comparison of what we are here and now with what we want to become later, where there is comparison of our practical life with the ideal or model to which we want to accommodate ourselves, true love cannot exist.</p>\n<p>All comparison is abominable, all comparison brings fear, envy, pride, etc. Fear of not achieving what we want, envy for the progress of others, pride because we believe ourselves to be superior to others. The important thing in the practical life in which we live, whether we are ugly, envious, selfish, greedy, etc., is not to presume to be saints, to start from absolute zero, and to understand ourselves deeply, as we really are here and now and not as we want to become or as we presume to be.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to dissolve the EGO, the MYSELF, if we do not learn to observe ourselves, to perceive in order to understand what we really are here and now in an effective and absolutely practical way.</p>\n<p>If we really want to understand, we must listen to our teachers, gurus, priests, preceptors, spiritual guides, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>The boys and girls of the new wave have lost the sense of respect, of veneration for our parents, teachers, spiritual guides, gurus, mahatmas, etc.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to understand the teachings when we do not know how to venerate and respect our parents, teachers, preceptors or spiritual guides.</p>\n<p>The simple mechanical recollection of what we have learned only by memory without deep understanding, mutilates the mind and the heart and engenders envy, fear, pride, etc.</p>\n<p>When we truly know how to listen in a conscious and profound way, a wonderful power arises within us, a formidable, natural, simple comprehension, free from all mechanical process, free from all cerebration, free from all remembrance.</p>\n<p>If the studentâ€™s brain is relieved of the enormous effort of memory that must be made, it will be totally possible to teach the structure of the nucleus and the periodic table of the elements to secondary school students and to make a bachelor understand relativity and Quanta.</p>\n<p>As we have talked with some secondary school teachers, we understand that they are terrified with true fanaticism of the old, antiquated and extemporaneous pedagogy. They want students to learn everything by heart even if they do not understand it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they accept that it is better to understand than to memorise, but then they insist that the formulas of physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc. should be engraved in the memory.</p>\n<p>It is clear that this concept is false because when a formula of physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc. is duly understood not only at the intellectual level, but also at the other levels of the mind such as the unconscious, subconscious, infraconscious, etc. etc. etc. It does not need to be engraved in the memory, it becomes part of our psyche and can manifest as immediate instinctive knowledge when circumstances of life require it.</p>\n<p>This INTEGRAL knowledge gives us a form of OMNISCIENCE, a mode of conscious objective manifestation.</p>\n<p>In-depth understanding at all levels of the mind is only possible through deep introspective meditation.</p>"
