    "set:html": "<p>“Fundamental Education” is the science that allows us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things. Through this science we know the functioning of the mind because the mind is the instrument of knowledge and we must learn to manage that instrument, which is the basic core of the psychological self.</p>\n<p>In this work, we are taught in an almost objective way how to think, through investigation, analysis, comprehension and meditation.</p>\n<p>It informs us how to improve the memories of the memory, always using three factors: subject, object and place; memory is moved by interest, so you have to put interest into what you study so that it is recorded in the memory. Memory improves through the process of alchemical transmutation that students who are interested in their personal improvement will gradually learn.</p>\n<p>For Westerners, study begins at 6 years of age, that is, when it is estimated that they have the use of reason; for Orientals, especially Hindus, education begins from gestation; for Gnostics from courtship, that is, before conception.</p>\n<p>Future education will encompass two phases: one in charge of the parents and the other in charge of the teachers. Future education will put the students in the Divine knowledge of learning to be parents. What the woman requires is protection, shelter, which is why the girl clings more to the father when she is a child because she sees him as stronger and more vigorous; the boy requires love, care, pampering, which is why the boy clings more to the mother by natural instinct. Later, when the senses of both are perverted, the woman looks for a good match or also a man who loves her, when she is the one who should give love, and, the man looks for a woman who has the means to live or who has a profession; for others, the face and body shapes predominate for their senses.</p>\n<p>It is surprising to see the school texts, each work with thousands of questions, that the author answers in writing so that the students learn them by heart, the unfaithful memory is the depositary of the knowledge that young people study with so much effort, that entirely materialistic education enables them to earn a living when they finish their studies, but they know nothing about the life in which they are going to live, they enter it blindly, they were not even taught to reproduce the species in an exalted way, that teaching is in charge of the thugs in the shadow of impudence.</p>\n<p>It is required that the young person understand that the seed that produces the human organism is the most important factor for the life of man (species), it is blessed and therefore the misuse of it will damage his own offspring. In the altars of the Catholic Church, the host is kept in the Tabernacle with great veneration as representative of the body of Christ, that Sacred figure; is formed by the seed of wheat. In the living altar, that is, our physical body, our seed occupies the place of the sacred host of Christianity that follows the Historical Christ; in our own seed we keep the Christ in substance those of us who follow the living Christ who lives and throbs in the very depths of our own seed.</p>\n<p>With great interest we see that agronomists who are in charge of the knowledge of the plants that serve man, teach the peasants to respect the seed they water in the fields, we see that they have improved the quality of the seeds to produce better harvests, keeping large silos of cereal stocks, so that the seeds that they produced with so much effort are not lost. We see how veterinarians, who are in charge of managing the life of animals, have managed to produce breeders or stallions whose cost is a hundred times greater than the product of meat, which indicates that it is the seed they produce, the reason for such a high cost. Only official medicine, which is in charge of the human species, tells us nothing about the improvement of the seed; we positively regret this delay and inform our readers that the human seed is the easiest to improve, through the permanent use of three basic foods: through what we think, what we breathe and what we eat. If we only think of vagueness, of bland, unimportant things, so will the seed we produce because thought is determining for said production. The young person who studies differs from the one who does not receive education in aspect and presence, there is a change in personality; The fact of breathing digested beers in bars and canteens, determines over the lives of the parishioners who frequent those places: The people who feed on cakes, pork, beer, spices, alcohol and aphrodisiac foods, live a passionate life that leads them to fornication.</p>\n<p>Every fornicating animal is foul-smelling: donkeys, pigs, goats and even poultry despite being birds, such as the domestic rooster. You can easily appreciate the difference that exists between fornicators and those that man makes chaste by force to exploit them, observe the gonads of the racehorse to those of the draft horses, between the fighting bulls and the stallions that appear daily in the press, the boar or breeding pig, even in small animals such as the rat that is tremendously passionate and its appearance is always repugnant, the same thing happens in the fornicating male who covers his stench with deodorants and perfumes. When man becomes chaste, pure and holy, in thought, word and deed, he recovers his lost childhood, becomes beautiful in body and soul and his body does not perspire fetidity.</p>\n<p>How is pre-natal education achieved? This happens between couples who follow chastity, that is, who never lose their seed in nonchalance and ephemeral pleasure, thus: The spouses want to give body to a new being, they agree and ask Heaven to be guided for the event of fertilization, then in a permanent attitude of love they live together happily and festively, they take advantage of the time when nature is more prodigal, just as the peasants do to sow, they use the process of alchemical transmutation joining together as husband and wife, which allows the escape of a strong and vigorous sperm, improved by the practices previously known and the event of divine conception is achieved by this means, once the woman perceives that she is pregnant, she separates from the man, that is, conjugal life ends, this must be done easily by the chaste man because he is full of grace and superhuman power, by all means he makes life pleasant for his wife so that she does not resort to discomfort or similar things because all this has repercussions on the fetus that is being gestated, if this causes damage what will be the union that in a libidinous way people practice who have never received advice in this sense? Which gives reasons for many children to feel terrible passions from an early age and embarrass their mothers in a scandalous way.</p>\n<p>The mother knows that she is giving life to a new being which she keeps in her Living Temple, as a precious jewel, giving with her prayers and thoughts beautiful forms that will exalt the new creature, then comes the event of painless birth; in a simple and natural way for the glory of their parents. The couple keeps a diet that is generally forty days until the uterus that served as a cradle for the new being returns to its place, the man knows that the woman who raises the child must pamper and contemplate her, with healthy caresses because any violent passionate form has repercussions on the breasts of the mother and bring obstructions in the channels through which the precious liquid flows that will give life to the child of her womb, the woman who wants to put this teaching into practice will observe that the shame of having to operate on the breasts due to permanent obstructions disappears. Where there is chastity there is love and obedience, the children rise up in a natural way and all evil disappears, thus begins this fundamental education for the preparation of the personality of the new being who will already go to school prepared to continue the education that will allow him to live together and later earn his daily bread on his own.</p>\n<p>In the first 7 years the child forms his own personality so that they are as important as the months of gestation and what is expected of a being brought in such conditions is something that humans do not even suspect. Intelligence is an attribute of the Being, we have to know the Being.</p>\n<p>The I cannot know the Truth because the Truth does not belong to time and the I does.</p>\n<p>Fear and dread damage free initiative. Initiative is creative, fear is destructive.</p>\n<p>Analysing everything and meditating, we awaken the dormant conscience.</p>\n<p>The truth is the unknown from instant to instant, it has nothing to do with what one believes or does not believe; the truth is a matter of experiencing, living, understanding.</p>\n<p>JULIO MEDINA VIZCAÍNO\nS.
