Where do I come from? Why do I have to suffer? What is the object of this existence? etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Everyone on the path of life has asked ourselves these questions, everyone has at some point wanted to investigate, inquire, know the “why” of so many bitternesses, disappointments, struggles and sufferings, but unfortunately we always end up bottled up in some theory, in some opinion, in some belief in what the neighbour said, in what some decrepit old man answered us, etc.</p>\n<p>We have lost true innocence and the peace of a tranquil heart and therefore we are not able to directly experience the truth in all its rawness, we depend on what others say and it is clear that we are going down the wrong path.</p>\n<p>Capitalist society radically condemns atheists, those who do not believe in God.</p>\n<p>Marxist-Leninist Society condemns those who DO believe in GOD, but deep down both things are the same, a matter of opinions, whims of the people, projections of the mind. Neither credulity, nor incredulity, nor scepticism, mean having experienced the truth.</p>\n<p>The mind can afford to believe, doubt, opine, make conjectures, etc, but that is not experiencing the truth.</p>\n<p>We can also afford to believe in the sun or not believe in it and even doubt it, but the king star will continue to give light and life to everything that exists without our opinions having the slightest importance for it.</p>\n<p>Behind blind belief, behind incredulity and scepticism, hide many nuances of false morality and many mistaken concepts of false respectability in whose shadow the EGO is strengthened.</p>\n<p>Capitalist-type society and communist-type society each have in their own way and according to their whims, prejudices and theories, their special type of morality. What is moral within the capitalist bloc is immoral within the communist bloc and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Morality depends on customs, the place, the time. What is moral in one country is immoral in another country and what was moral in one era, is immoral in another era. Morality has no essential value whatsoever, analysing it thoroughly, it is one hundred percent stupid.</p>\n<p>Fundamental education does not teach morality, fundamental education teaches REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS and that is what the new generations need.</p>\n<p>Since the terrifying night of the centuries, in all times, there have always been men who went away from the world to seek the TRUTH.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to go away from the world to seek the TRUTH because it is found within the world and within man here and now.</p>\n<p>The TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment and it is not by separating ourselves from the world or abandoning our fellow human beings that we can discover it.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to say that every truth is half-truth and that every truth is half-error.</p>\n<p>The TRUTH is radical and IS or IS NOT, it can never be halfway, it can never be half-error.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to say: the TRUTH is of time and that what was in one time is not in another time.</p>\n<p>The TRUTH has nothing to do with time. The TRUTH is TIMELESS. The EGO is time and therefore cannot know the TRUTH.</p>\n<p>It is absurd to suppose conventional, temporal, relative truths. People confuse concepts and opinions with that which is the TRUTH.</p>\n<p>The TRUTH has nothing to do with opinions or with so-called conventional truths, because these are only inconsequential projections of the mind.</p>\n<p>The TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment and can only be experienced in the absence of the psychological EGO.</p>\n<p>The truth is not a question of sophisms, concepts, opinions. The truth can only be known through direct experience.</p>\n<p>The mind can only opine and opinions have nothing to do with the truth.</p>\n<p>The mind can never conceive the TRUTH.</p>\n<p>Teachers, schoolteachers, college teachers, university teachers, must experience the truth and point the way to their disciples.</p>\n<p>The TRUTH is a matter of direct experience, not a matter of theories, opinions or concepts.</p>\n<p>We can and should study but it is urgent to experience for ourselves and directly what truth there may be in each theory, concept, opinion, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>We must study, analyse, inquire, but we also need with unavoidable URGENCY to experience the TRUTH contained in everything that we study.</p>\n<p>It is impossible to experience the TRUTH while the mind is agitated, convulsed, tormented by conflicting opinions.</p>\n<p>It is only possible to experience the TRUTH when the mind is still, when the mind is in silence.</p>\n<p>The teachers and schoolteachers, college teachers and university teachers, must indicate to the students the path of deep inner meditation.</p>\n<p>The path of deep inner meditation leads us to the stillness and silence of the mind.</p>\n<p>When the mind is still, empty of thoughts, desires, opinions, etc., when the mind is in silence, the truth comes to us.</p>"
