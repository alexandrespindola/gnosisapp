Know yourself and you will know the universe and the Gods.</p>\n<p>The transcendental Science of Meditation has as its basic cornerstone this sacred motto of the ancient GREEK HIEROPHANTS.</p>\n<p>If we truly and sincerely want to establish the basis for correct meditation, it is necessary to understand ourselves on all levels of the mind.</p>\n<p>Establishing the correct basis for meditation is, in fact, being free from ambition, selfishness, fear, hatred, the greed for psychic powers, the desire for results, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>It is clear to everyone and beyond any doubt that after establishing the BASIC CORNERSTONE of meditation, the mind becomes still and in deep and imposing silence.</p>\n<p>From a strictly logical point of view, it is absurd to want to experience THE REAL without knowing ourselves.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to understand in an INTEGRAL way and in all areas of the mind, each problem as it arises in the mind, each desire, each memory, each psychological defect, etc.</p>\n<p>It is clear to all that during the practice of meditation, all the psychological defects that characterise us, all our joys and sorrows, countless memories, multiple impulses that come from the outside world or from the inner world, desires of all kinds, passions of all species, old resentments, hatreds, etc., pass across the screen of the mind in a sinister procession.</p>\n<p>Anyone who truly wants to establish the basic stone of meditation in their mind must pay full attention to these positive and negative values of our understanding and understand them in an integral way, not only on the merely intellectual level, but also in all the subconscious, infraconscious and unconscious areas of the mind. We must never forget that the mind has many levels.</p>\n<p>The in-depth study of all these values means, in fact, self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>Every film on the screen of the mind has a beginning and an end. When the parade of forms, desires, passions, ambitions, memories, etc., ends, then the mind becomes still and in deep silence, EMPTY of all kinds of thoughts.</p>\n<p>Modern students of psychology need to experience the ILLUMINATING VOID. The irruption of the VOID within our own mind allows us to experience, feel, and live an element that transforms, that ELEMENT is the REAL.</p>\n<p>Distinguish between a mind that is still and a mind that is violently stilled.</p>\n<p>Distinguish between a mind that is in silence and a mind that is forcibly silenced.</p>\n<p>In the light of any logical deduction, we have to understand that when the mind is violently stilled, deep down and on other levels it is not still and struggles to break free.</p>\n<p>From an analytical point of view, we have to understand that when the mind is forcibly silenced, deep down it is not in silence, it screams and despairs terribly.</p>\n<p>The true stillness and natural and spontaneous silence of the mind comes to us as a grace, as a bliss, when the very intimate film of our own existence ends on the wonderful screen of the intellect.</p>\n<p>Only when the mind is naturally and spontaneously still, only when the mind is in delicious silence, does the irruption of the ILLUMINATING VOID come.</p>\n<p>THE VOID is not easy to explain. It is not definable or describable, any concept that we emit about it may fail at the main point.</p>\n<p>The VOID cannot be described or expressed in words. This is because human language has been created primarily to designate existing things, thoughts and feelings; it is not adequate to express clearly and specifically, non-existent phenomena, things and feelings.</p>\n<p>Trying to discuss the VOID within the limits of a language limited by the forms of existence, really beyond any doubt, is in fact foolish and absolutely wrong.</p>\n<p>“THE VOID is NON-EXISTENCE, and EXISTENCE IS NOT THE VOID.”</p>\n<p>“FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM THE VOID, AND THE VOID DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM.”</p>\n<p>“FORM IS VOID AND THE VOID IS FORM, IT IS BECAUSE OF THE VOID THAT THINGS EXIST.”</p>\n<p>“THE VOID AND EXISTENCE COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND DO NOT OPPOSE EACH OTHER.” THE VOID AND EXISTENCE INCLUDE AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER.</p>\n<p>“WHEN BEINGS OF NORMAL SENSIBILITY SEE AN OBJECT, THEY SEE ONLY ITS EXISTING ASPECT, THEY DO NOT SEE ITS VOID ASPECT.”</p>\n<p>“Every ILLUMINATED BEING can simultaneously see the existing and VOID aspect of anything.</p>\n<p>“THE VOID is simply a term that denotes the NON-SUBSTANTIAL and NON-PERSONAL nature of beings, and an indication of the state of absolute detachment and freedom.”</p>\n<p>The Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities must study our Revolutionary Psychology in depth and then teach their students the path that leads to the experience of the REAL</p>\n<p>It is only possible to reach the EXPERIENCE OF THE REAL when thought has ended.</p>\n<p>The irruption of the VOID allows us to experience the CLEAR LIGHT of PURE REALITY.</p>\n<p>That PRESENT KNOWLEDGE in reality EMPTY, without characteristic and without colour, EMPTY OF NATURE, is the TRUE REALITY, the UNIVERSAL GOODNESS.</p>\n<p>YOUR INTELLIGENCE whose true nature is the VOID that should not be seen as the VOID of NOTHING but as INTELLIGENCE ITSELF unhindered, brilliant, universal and happy is CONSCIOUSNESS, the Universally Wise BUDDHA.</p>\n<p>YOUR own EMPTY CONSCIOUSNESS and brilliant and joyful INTELLIGENCE are inseparable. Their UNION of the DHARMA-KAYA; THE STATE OF PERFECT ILLUMINATION.</p>\n<p>Your own BRIGHT, EMPTY CONSCIOUSNESS inseparable from the great BODY OF SPLENDOR, has neither BIRTH NOR DEATH and is the immutable light AMITARA BUDDHA.</p>\n<p>This knowledge is enough. Recognising the VOID of your own INTELLIGENCE as the STATE of BUDDHA and considering it as your own CONSCIOUSNESS, is to continue in the DIVINE SPIRIT of BUDDHA.</p>\n<p>Keep your INTELLECT without distracting yourself during MEDITATION, forget that you are in Meditation, do not think that you are meditating because when you think that you are meditating, this thought is enough to disturb meditation. YOUR mind must be EMPTY to experience the REAL.</p>"
