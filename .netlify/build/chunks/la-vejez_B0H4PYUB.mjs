The I hides what is not convenient for it.</p>\n<p>It is completely demonstrated by observation and experience that when vices abandon us, we like to think that we were the ones who abandoned them.</p>\n<p>The heart of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL does not become better with the years, but worse, it always turns to stone, and if in youth we were greedy, liars, irascible, in old age we will be much more so.</p>\n<p>Old people live in the past, old people are the result of many yesterdays, the elderly completely ignore the moment in which we live, old people are accumulated memory.</p>\n<p>The only way to reach perfect old age is by dissolving the PSYCHOLOGICAL I. When we learn to die from moment to moment, we reach sublime old age.</p>\n<p>Old age has a great sense of peace and freedom for those who have already dissolved the I.</p>\n<p>When passions have died in a radical, total and definitive way, one is free not from one master, but from many masters.</p>\n<p>It is very difficult to find in life innocent elders who no longer possess even the remnants of the I; that kind of elders are infinitely happy and live from instant to instant.</p>\n<p>The man greyed in WISDOM. The elder in knowledge, the lord of love, becomes in fact the beacon of light that wisely guides the current of the innumerable centuries.</p>\n<p>In the world there have existed and currently exist some ELDER MASTERS who do not even have the last remnants of the I. These GNOSTIC ARHATS are as exotic and divine as the lotus flower.</p>\n<p>THE VENERABLE ELDER MASTER who has dissolved the PLURALISED I in a radical and definitive way is the perfect expression of PERFECT WISDOM, DIVINE LOVE AND SUBLIME POWER.</p>\n<p>THE ELDER MASTER who no longer has the I, is in fact the full manifestation of the DIVINE BEING.</p>\n<p>Those SUBLIME ELDERS, those GNOSTIC ARHATS have illuminated the world since ancient times, let us remember the BUDDHA, MOSES, HERMES, RAMARKRISHNA, DANIEL, THE HOLY LAMA, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>School, college and university teachers, female teachers, parents, should teach new generations to respect and venerate the elderly.</p>\n<p>THAT which has no name, THAT which is DIVINE, THAT which is REAL, has three aspects: WISDOM, LOVE, WORD.</p>\n<p>THE DIVINE as FATHER is COSMIC WISDOM, as MOTHER is INFINITE LOVE, as son is the WORD.</p>\n<p>In the father of the family is found the symbol of wisdom. In the mother of the home is found LOVE, the children symbolise the word.</p>\n<p>The elderly Father deserves all the support of the children. The Father, already old, cannot work and it is fair that the children maintain and respect him.</p>\n<p>The Adorable Mother, already elderly, cannot work and therefore it is necessary that the sons and daughters look after her and love her and make that love a religion.</p>\n<p>Whoever does not know how to love his Father, whoever does not know how to ADORE his MOTHER, marches on the path of the left hand, on the path of error.</p>\n<p>Children have no right to judge their Parents, no one is perfect in this world and those of us who do not have certain defects in one direction, have them in another, we are all cut from the same cloth.</p>\n<p>Some underestimate PATERNAL LOVE, others even laugh at PATERNAL LOVE. Those who behave like this in life have not even entered the path that leads to THAT which has no name.</p>\n<p>The ungrateful son who hates his Father and forgets his Mother is really the true perverse one who hates everything that is DIVINE.</p>\n<p>THE REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS does not mean INGRATITUDE, forgetting the father, underestimating the adorable Mother. THE REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS is WISDOM LOVE and PERFECT POWER.</p>\n<p>In the Father is found the symbol of wisdom and in the Mother is found the living source of LOVE without whose purest essence it is really impossible to achieve the highest INTIMATE REALISATIONS.</p>"
