    "set:html": "<p>In our home and at school, parents and teachers always tell us what we should think, but never in our lives do they teach us HOW to think.</p>\n<p>Knowing what to think is relatively easy. Our parents, teachers, tutors, book authors, etc. etc. etc., each one is a dictator in their own way, each one wants us to think according to their dictates, demands, theories, prejudices, etc.</p>\n<p>Dictators of the mind abound like weeds. There is a perverse tendency everywhere to enslave the minds of others, to bottle them up, to force them to live within certain norms, prejudices, schools, etc.</p>\n<p>The thousands and millions of DICTATORS of the mind have never wanted to respect anyone’s mental freedom. If someone does not think like them, they are labelled as perverse, renegade, ignorant, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Everyone wants to enslave everyone else, everyone wants to trample on the intellectual freedom of others. No one wants to respect the freedom of thought of others. Each one feels JUDICIOUS, WISE, WONDERFUL, and naturally wants others to be like them, to make them their model, to think like them.</p>\n<p>The mind has been abused too much. Observe the MERCHANTS, and their advertising through newspapers, radio, television, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Commercial propaganda is done in a dictatorial way. Buy such and such soap! Such and such shoes! So many pesos! So many dollars! Buy right now! Immediately! Don’t leave it until tomorrow! It has to be immediately! etc. They only need to say if you don’t obey, we’ll put you in jail, or kill you.</p>\n<p>The father wants to force his ideas on his son, and the schoolteacher scolds, punishes, and gives low grades if the boy or girl does not DICTATORIALLY accept the teacher’s ideas.</p>\n<p>Half of humanity wants to enslave the minds of the other half of humanity. This tendency to enslave the minds of others is clearly evident when we study the black page of black history.</p>\n<p>Everywhere there have been and are BLOODY DICTATORSHIPS determined to enslave the people. Bloody dictatorships that dictate what people should think. Woe to anyone who tries to think freely: that person inevitably goes to concentration camps, to Siberia, to prison, to forced labour, to the gallows, to the firing squad, to exile, etc.</p>\n<p>Neither TEACHERS, nor PARENTS, nor books, want to teach HOW TO THINK.</p>\n<p>People love to force others to think according to how they believe it should be, and it is clear that everyone in this is a DICTATOR in their own way, each one believes they have the last word, each one firmly believes that everyone else should think like them, because they are the best of the best.</p>\n<p>Parents, teachers, employers, etc. etc. etc., scold and scold their subordinates again and again.</p>\n<p>It is appalling that horrible tendency of humanity to disrespect others, to trample on the minds of others, to cage, lock up, enslave, and chain the thoughts of others.</p>\n<p>The husband wants to force his ideas into his wife’s head, his doctrine, his ideas, etc., and the wife wants to do the same.</p>\n<p>Many times, husband and wife divorce due to incompatibility of ideas.</p>\n<p>The spouses do not want to understand the need to respect the intellectual freedom of others.</p>\n<p>No spouse has the right to enslave the mind of another spouse. Each one is in fact worthy of respect. Each one has the right to think as they please, to profess their religion, to belong to the political party they want.</p>\n<p>Schoolchildren are forced to think about such and such ideas, but they are not taught how to manage their minds.</p>\n<p>The mind of children is tender, elastic, ductile, and that of the elderly is already hard, fixed, like clay in a mould, it no longer changes, it can no longer change.</p>\n<p>The minds of children and young people are susceptible to many changes, they can change.</p>\n<p>Children and young people can be taught how to THINK. It is very difficult to teach old people HOW TO THINK because they are already as they are, and they die that way.</p>\n<p>It is very rare to find an old person in life interested in changing radically.</p>\n<p>The minds of people are moulded from childhood. That is what parents and schoolteachers prefer to do. They enjoy shaping the minds of children and young people.</p>\n<p>A mind placed in a mould is in fact a conditioned mind, an enslaved mind.</p>\n<p>It is necessary for TEACHERS to break the shackles of the mind.</p>\n<p>It is urgent that teachers know how to direct the minds of children towards true freedom so that they are not enslaved any more.</p>\n<p>It is essential that teachers teach their students HOW ONE SHOULD THINK.</p>\n<p>Teachers must understand the need to teach students the path of analysis, meditation, and understanding.</p>\n<p>No understanding person should ever accept anything dogmatically. It is urgent to investigate first. Understand, inquire, before accepting.</p>\n<p>In other words, we will say that there is no need to accept, but to investigate, analyse, meditate, and understand. When understanding is complete, acceptance is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>It is useless to fill our heads with intellectual information if, when we leave school, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THINK and continue as LIVING AUTOMATONS, as machines, repeating the same routine as our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, etc.</p>\n<p>Always repeating the same thing, living the life of machines, from home to the office and from the office to home, getting married to become little machines for making children, that is not living, and if that is what we study for, and that is why we go to school and college and university for ten or fifteen years, it would be better not to study.</p>\n<p>MAHATMA GANDHI was a very unique man. Many times, Protestant pastors sat at his door for hours on end struggling to convert him to Christianity in its Protestant form.</p>\n<p>Gandhi did not accept the teaching of the pastors, nor did he reject it, he UNDERSTOOD it, he RESPECTED it, and that is all.</p>\n<p>Many times, the MAHATMA said: “I am Brahman, Jewish, Christian, Muhammadan, etc. etc. etc.”</p>\n<p>THE MAHATMA understood that all religions are necessary because they all preserve the same ETERNAL VALUES.</p>\n<p>That of accepting or rejecting any doctrine OR concept, reveals a lack of mental maturity.</p>\n<p>When we reject or accept something, it is because we have not understood it.</p>\n<p>Where there is UNDERSTANDING, acceptance or rejection is superfluous.</p>\n<p>The mind that believes, the mind that does not believe, the mind that doubts, is an IGNORANT mind.</p>\n<p>The path of WISDOM does not consist of BELIEVING or not BELIEVING or DOUBTING.</p>\n<p>The path of WISDOM consists of INQUIRING, analysing, meditating, and EXPERIMENTING.</p>\n<p>TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment. Truth has nothing to do with what one believes or ceases to believe, nor with scepticism.</p>\n<p>TRUTH is not a question of accepting something or rejecting it. TRUTH is a question of EXPERIENCING, LIVING, UNDERSTANDING.</p>\n<p>All the efforts of TEACHERS should ultimately lead students to the EXPERIENCE of the real, of the true.</p>\n<p>It is URGENT that TEACHERS abandon that antiquated and pernicious tendency always aimed at MODELLING the PLASTIC and DUCTILE minds of children.</p>\n<p>It is absurd that ADULT people full of prejudices, passions, antiquated preconceptions, etc. thus trample on the minds of children and young people, trying to model their minds according to their stale, clumsy, antiquated ideas.</p>\n<p>It is better to respect the INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM of STUDENTS, to respect their mental promptness, their creative spontaneity.</p>\n<p>Teachers have no right to cage the minds of students.</p>\n<p>The fundamental thing is not to DICTATE to the MIND of the students what they should think, but to teach them fully, HOW TO THINK.</p>\n<p>The MIND is the instrument of KNOWLEDGE, and it is necessary for TEACHERS to teach their students to wisely handle that instrument.</p>"
