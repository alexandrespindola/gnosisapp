The EVOLUTIONARY mechanics cannot develop them.</p>\n<p>The development of such latent possibilities is only possible in well-defined conditions and this requires tremendous individual SUPER-EFFORTS and efficient help from those MASTERS who have already done that work in the past.</p>\n<p>Whoever wants to develop all their latent possibilities to become a man, must enter the path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\n<p>THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is the GRAIN, the SEED; from that seed can be born the TREE OF LIFE, the TRUE MAN, that MAN who DIOGENES was looking for with a lighted lamp through the streets of ATHENS at midday and that he unfortunately could not find.</p>\n<p>It is NOT a LAW that this grain, that this special seed can develop, the normal, the natural thing is that it is lost.</p>\n<p>THE TRUE MAN is as different from the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL as LIGHTNING is from a cloud.</p>\n<p>If the grain does not die the seed does not germinate, it is necessary, it is urgent that the EGO, the I, the MYSELF dies, so that the MAN is born.</p>\n<p>The Masters and Mistresses of Schools, Colleges and Universities, must teach their students the PATH of REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS, only in this way is it possible to achieve the death of the EGO.</p>\n<p>EMPHASIZING we can affirm that the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS is not only rare in this world, but it is becoming rarer and rarer.</p>\n<p>The REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS has three perfectly defined factors: First, Dying; Second, Being Born; Third, Sacrifice for humanity. The order of the factors does not alter the product.</p>\n<p>DYING is a matter of REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS and DISSOLUTION of the PSYCHOLOGICAL I.</p>\n<p>BEING BORN is a matter of SEXUAL TRANSMUTATION, this matter corresponds to TRANSCENDENTAL SEXOLOGY, whoever wants to study this topic, must write to us and know our Gnostic books.</p>\n<p>SACRIFICE for humanity is CONSCIOUS UNIVERSAL CHARITY.</p>\n<p>If we do not desire the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, if we do not make tremendous SUPER-EFFORTS to develop those latent possibilities that will lead us to INTIMATE SELF-REALIZATION, it is clear that these possibilities will never be developed.</p>\n<p>Very few are those who SELF-REALIZE, those who are saved and there is no injustice in this, why should the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL have what it does not want?</p>\n<p>A total and definitive radical change is needed, but not all beings want that change, they do not desire it, they do not know it and they are told and they do not understand it, they do not comprehend it, they are not interested. Why should they be given by force what they do not want?</p>\n<p>The truth is that before the individual acquires NEW FACULTIES or NEW POWERS, which he does not know even remotely and which he does not yet possess, he must acquire faculties and powers that he mistakenly believes he has, but which he does not really have.</p>"
