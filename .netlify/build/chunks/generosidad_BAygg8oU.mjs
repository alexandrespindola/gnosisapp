Experiences, old grievances, past jealousies, all of this accumulated in memory, destroys love.</p>\n<p>Many resentful wives could be happy if they had enough generosity to forget the past and live in the present, adoring their husbands.</p>\n<p>Many husbands could be truly happy with their wives if they had enough generosity to forgive old mistakes and forget grudges and accumulated bitterness in their memory.</p>\n<p>It is necessary, it is urgent that marriages understand the deep significance of the moment.</p>\n<p>Husbands and wives should always feel like newlyweds, forgetting the past and living happily in the present.</p>\n<p>Love and resentment are incompatible atomic substances. In love, resentments of any kind cannot exist. Love is eternal forgiveness.</p>\n<p>Love exists in those who feel true anguish for the sufferings of their friends and enemies. True love exists in the one who wholeheartedly works for the well-being of the humble, the poor, the needy.</p>\n<p>Love exists in the one who spontaneously and naturally feels sympathy for the peasant who waters the furrow with his sweat, for the villager who suffers, for the beggar who asks for a coin, and for the humble, anguished and sick dog that dies of hunger by the side of the road.</p>\n<p>When we wholeheartedly help someone, when we naturally and spontaneously take care of the tree and water the flowers in the garden without anyone asking us to, there is authentic generosity, true sympathy, true love.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the world, people do not have true generosity. People are only concerned with their own selfish achievements, desires, successes, knowledge, experiences, sufferings, pleasures, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>In the world there are many people who only possess false generosity. False generosity exists in the astute politician, in the electoral fox who squanders money with the selfish purpose of gaining power, prestige, position, wealth, etc., etc. We must not confuse chalk with cheese.</p>\n<p>True generosity is absolutely disinterested, but it can easily be confused with the false, selfish generosity of political foxes, capitalist rogues, satyrs who covet a woman, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>We must be generous of heart. True generosity is not of the Mind, authentic generosity is the perfume of the heart.</p>\n<p>If people had generosity, they would forget all the resentments accumulated in their memory, all the painful experiences of many yesterdays, and learn to live from moment to moment, always happy, always generous, full of true sincerity.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the SELF is memory and lives in the past, always wanting to return to the past. The past finishes people off, destroys happiness, kills love.</p>\n<p>The mind bottled up in the past can never fully understand the deep significance of the moment in which we live.</p>\n<p>There are many people who write to us seeking comfort, asking for a precious balm to heal their aching hearts, but few are those who are concerned with comforting the afflicted.</p>\n<p>There are many people who write to us to relate the miserable state in which they live, but rare are those who break the only bread that is to feed them to share it with other needy people.</p>\n<p>People do not want to understand that behind every effect there is a cause and that only by altering the cause do we modify the effect.</p>\n<p>The SELF, our dear SELF, is energy that has lived in our predecessors and that has originated certain past causes whose present effects condition our existence.</p>\n<p>We need GENEROSITY to modify causes and transform effects. We need generosity to wisely steer the ship of our existence.</p>\n<p>We need generosity to radically transform our own life.</p>\n<p>Legitimate effective generosity is not of the mind. Authentic sympathy and true sincere affection can never be the result of fear.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to understand that fear destroys sympathy, ends the generosity of the heart and annihilates in us the delicious perfume of LOVE.</p>\n<p>Fear is the root of all corruption, the secret origin of all war, the mortal poison that degenerates and kills.</p>\n<p>Teachers in schools, colleges and universities must understand the need to guide their students along the path of true generosity, courage, and sincerity of heart.</p>\n<p>The stale and clumsy people of the past generation, instead of understanding what that poison of fear is, cultivated it as a fatal hothouse flower. The result of such a procedure was corruption, chaos and anarchy.</p>\n<p>Teachers must understand the hour in which we live, the critical state in which we find ourselves and the need to raise new generations on the foundations of a revolutionary ethic that is in tune with the atomic era that is beginning in these moments of anguish and pain amidst the august thunder of thought.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is based on a revolutionary psychology and a revolutionary ethic, in accordance with the new vibratory rhythm of the new era.</p>\n<p>The sense of cooperation will have to completely displace the horrible battling of selfish competition. It becomes impossible to know how to cooperate when we exclude the principle of effective and revolutionary generosity.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to understand fully, not only on the intellectual level, but also in the different unconscious recesses of the unconscious and subconscious mind what is the lack of generosity and the horror of selfishness. Only by becoming aware of what selfishness and lack of generosity is in us does the delicious fragrance of TRUE LOVE and EFFECTIVE GENEROSITY, which is not of the mind, sprout in our hearts.</p>"
