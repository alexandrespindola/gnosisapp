    "set:html": "<p>A man was born, lived for sixty-five years, and died. But where was he before 1900 and where might he be after 1965? Official science knows nothing about all this. This is the general formulation of all questions about life and death.</p>\n<p>Axiomatically we can affirm: “MAN DIES BECAUSE HIS TIME ENDS, THERE IS NO TOMORROW FOR THE DEAD PERSON’S PERSONALITY”.</p>\n<p>Each day is a wave of time, each month is another wave of time, each year is also another wave of time and all these waves chained together constitute the GREAT WAVE OF LIFE.</p>\n<p>Time is round and the life of the HUMAN PERSONALITY is a closed curve.</p>\n<p>The life of the HUMAN PERSONALITY develops in its time, is born in its time and dies in its time, it can never exist beyond its time.</p>\n<p>This matter of time is a problem that has been studied by many wise men. Beyond all doubt, time is the FOURTH DIMENSION.</p>\n<p>EUCLID’s Geometry is only applicable to the THREE-DIMENSIONAL world but the world has seven dimensions and the FOURTH is TIME.</p>\n<p>The human mind conceives ETERNITY as the prolongation of time in a straight line, nothing can be more mistaken than this concept because ETERNITY is the FIFTH DIMENSION.</p>\n<p>Each moment of existence happens in time and is repeated eternally.</p>\n<p>Death and LIFE are two extremes that touch. A life ends for the man who dies but another begins. A time ends and another begins, death is intimately linked to the ETERNAL RETURN.</p>\n<p>This means that we have to return, return to this world after death to repeat the same drama of existence, but if, the human PERSONALITY perishes with death, who or what is it that returns?</p>\n<p>It is necessary to clarify once and for all that the I is the one that continues after death, that the I is the one who returns, that the I is the one who returns to this vale of tears.</p>\n<p>It is necessary that our readers do not confuse the Law of RETURN with the Theory of REINCARNATION taught by MODERN THEOSOPHY.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned theory of REINCARNATION had its origin in the cult of KRISHNA which is a VEDIC-type HINDUSTANI RELIGION, unfortunately retouched and adulterated by the reformers.</p>\n<p>In the authentic original cult of Krishna, only the Heroes, the Guides, those who already possess SACRED INDIVIDUALITY, are the only ones who reincarnate.</p>\n<p>THE PLURALIZED I RETURNS, returns but this is not REINCARNATION. The masses, the multitudes RETURN, but that is not REINCARNATION.</p>\n<p>The idea of the RETURN of things and phenomena, the idea of eternal repetition is not very old and we can find it in PYTHAGOREAN WISDOM and in the ancient cosmogony of HINDUSTAN.</p>\n<p>The eternal return of the Days and Nights of BRAHAMA, the incessant repetition of the KALPAS, etc., are invariably associated in a very intimate way with Pythagorean Wisdom and with the Law of eternal RECURRENCE or eternal RETURN.</p>\n<p>Gautama the BUDDHA very wisely taught the DOCTRINE of ETERNAL RETURN and the wheel of successive lives, but his DOCTRINE was very adulterated by his followers.</p>\n<p>Every RETURN implies of course the manufacture of a new HUMAN PERSONALITY, this is formed during the first seven years of childhood.</p>\n<p>The family environment, street life and school, give the HUMAN PERSONALITY its characteristic original hue.</p>\n<p>THE EXAMPLE of elders is definitive for the infant personality.</p>\n<p>The child learns more by example than by precept. The wrong way of living, the absurd example, the degenerate customs of the elders, give the child’s personality that peculiar sceptical and perverse hue of the time in which we live.</p>\n<p>In these modern times adultery has become more common than potatoes and onions and as is only logical this causes Dantesque scenes within homes.</p>\n<p>There are many children these days who have to endure, full of pain and resentment, the whips and sticks of the stepfather or stepmother. It is clear that in this way the child’s PERSONALITY develops within the framework of pain, resentment and hatred.</p>\n<p>There is a vulgar saying that says: “Someone else’s child smells bad everywhere”. Naturally there are also exceptions to this but these can be counted on the fingers of one hand and there are fingers to spare.</p>\n<p>The altercations between father and mother over jealousy, the crying and lamentations of the afflicted mother or the oppressed, ruined and desperate husband, leave an indelible mark of deep pain and melancholy on the child’s PERSONALITY that is never forgotten throughout life.</p>\n<p>In elegant houses, proud ladies mistreat their maids when they go to the beauty salon or put on make-up. The pride of the ladies feels mortally wounded.</p>\n<p>The child who sees all these scenes of infamy feels hurt to the core whether he takes the side of his haughty and proud mother, or the side of the unhappy vain and humiliated maid and the result is usually catastrophic for the INFANT PERSONALITY.</p>\n<p>Since television was invented, family unity has been lost. In other times the man arrived from the street and was received by his wife with great joy. Nowadays the woman no longer goes out to receive her husband at the door because she is busy watching television.</p>\n<p>Within modern homes the father, the mother, the sons, the daughters, seem like unconscious automatons in front of the television screen.</p>\n<p>Now the husband cannot discuss absolutely anything with his wife about the problems of the day, work, etc., etc. because she seems like a sleepwalker watching yesterday’s film, the Dantesque scenes of Al Capone, the last dance of the new wave, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Children raised in this new type of ultra-modern home only think about cannons, pistols, toy machine guns to imitate and live in their own way all the Dantesque scenes of crime as they have seen them on the television screen.</p>\n<p>It is a pity that this wonderful invention of television is used for destructive purposes. If humanity used this invention in a dignified way either to study the natural sciences, or to teach the true royal art of MOTHER NATURE, or to give sublime teachings to people, then this invention would be a blessing for humanity, it could be used intelligently to cultivate the human personality.</p>\n<p>It is patently absurd to nourish the INFANT PERSONALITY with arrhythmic, inharmonious, vulgar music. It is stupid to nourish the PERSONALITY of children with tales of thieves and policemen, scenes of vice and prostitution, dramas of adultery, pornography, etc.</p>\n<p>The result of such a procedure can be seen in the Rebels without a Cause, the premature murderers, etc.</p>\n<p>It is regrettable that mothers lash their children, beat them, insult them with broken and cruel words. The result of such conduct is resentment, hatred, loss of love, etc.</p>\n<p>In practice we have been able to see that children raised between sticks, whips and screams, become vulgar people full of boorishness and lack of any sense of respect and veneration.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to understand the need to establish a true balance within homes.</p>\n<p>It is essential to know that sweetness and severity must be mutually balanced on the two plates of the scales of justice.</p>\n<p>THE FATHER represents SEVERITY, The MOTHER represents SWEETNESS. The Father personifies WISDOM. The MOTHER symbolises LOVE.</p>\n<p>WISDOM and LOVE, SEVERITY and SWEETNESS are mutually balanced on the two plates of the cosmic scales.</p>\n<p>Fathers and Mothers of families must balance each other for the good of homes.</p>\n<p>It is urgent, it is necessary, that all Fathers and Mothers of families understand the need to sow in the infant mind the ETERNAL VALUES of the SPIRIT.</p>\n<p>It is regrettable that modern children no longer possess the sense of VENERATION, this is due to the tales of cowboy thieves and policemen, television, cinema, etc. have perverted the minds of children.</p>\n<p>The REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY of the GNOSTIC MOVEMENT, in a clear and precise way makes a fundamental distinction between the EGO and the ESSENCE.</p>\n<p>During the first three or four years of life, only the beauty of the ESSENCE is manifested in the child, then the child is tender, sweet, beautiful in all its Psychological aspects.</p>\n<p>When the EGO begins to control the tender personality of the child all that beauty of the ESSENCE disappears and in its place the Psychological defects of every human being then emerge.</p>\n<p>Just as we must distinguish between EGO and ESSENCE, it is also necessary to distinguish between PERSONALITY and ESSENCE.</p>\n<p>The human Being is born with the ESSENCE but is not born with the PERSONALITY, the latter needs to be created.</p>\n<p>PERSONALITY and ESSENCE must develop in a harmonious and balanced way.</p>\n<p>In practice we have been able to verify that when the PERSONALITY develops exaggeratedly at the expense of the ESSENCE, the result is the VILLAIN.</p>\n<p>The observation and experience of many years has allowed us to understand that when the ESSENCE is fully developed without paying the slightest attention to the harmonious cultivation of the PERSONALITY, the result is the mystic without intellect, without personality, noble of heart but maladjusted, incapable.</p>\n<p>The HARMONIOUS development of PERSONALITY and ESSENCE results in men and women of genius.</p>\n<p>In the ESSENCE we have everything that is our own, in the PERSONALITY everything that is borrowed.</p>\n<p>In the ESSENCE we have our innate qualities, in the PERSONALITY we have the example of our elders, what we have learned in the Home, in the School, in the Street.</p>\n<p>It is urgent that children receive food for the ESSENCE and food for the PERSONALITY.</p>\n<p>The ESSENCE is nourished with tenderness, unlimited affection, love, music, flowers, beauty, harmony, etc.</p>\n<p>The PERSONALITY must be nourished with the good example of our elders, with the wise teaching of the school, etc.</p>\n<p>It is essential that children enter primary school at the age of seven after passing through kindergarten.</p>\n<p>Children should learn their first letters by playing, so that studying becomes attractive, delightful, happy for them.</p>\n<p>FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION teaches that from the same KINDERGARTEN or nursery school, each of the three aspects of the HUMAN PERSONALITY, known as thought, movement and action, must be given special attention, so that the child’s personality develops in a harmonious and balanced way.</p>\n<p>The question of the creation of the child’s PERSONALITY and its development is a matter of very serious responsibility for PARENTS OF FAMILIES and SCHOOL TEACHERS.</p>\n<p>The quality of the HUMAN PERSONALITY depends exclusively on the type of Psychological material with which it was created and nourished.</p>\n<p>Around PERSONALITY, ESSENCE, EGO or I, there is much confusion among students of PSYCHOLOGY.</p>\n<p>Some confuse PERSONALITY with ESSENCE and others confuse EGO or I with ESSENCE.</p>\n<p>There are many Pseudo-Esoteric or Pseudo-Occultist Schools whose goal is the IMPERSONAL LIFE.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to clarify that it is not the PERSONALITY that we have to dissolve.</p>\n<p>It is urgent to know that we need to disintegrate the EGO, the ME MYSELF, the I, reducing it to cosmic dust.</p>\n<p>The PERSONALITY is only a vehicle of action, a vehicle that was necessary to create, to manufacture.</p>\n<p>In the world there are CALIGULAS, ATTILAS, HITLERS, etc. All types of personality, however perverse they may have been, can be radically transformed when the EGO or I is totally dissolved.</p>\n<p>This matter of the Dissolution of the EGO or I confuses and bothers many Pseudo-Esotericists. These are convinced that the EGO is DIVINE, they believe that the EGO or I is the same BEING, the DIVINE MONAD, etc.</p>\n<p>It is necessary, it is urgent, it is unavoidable to understand that the EGO or I has nothing DIVINE about it.</p>\n<p>THE EGO or I is the SATAN of the BIBLE, a bunch of memories, desires, passions, hatreds, resentments, concupiscences, adulteries, heritage of family, races, nation, etc., etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Many stupidly affirm that in us there is a SUPERIOR or DIVINE I and an INFERIOR I.</p>\n<p>SUPERIOR and INFERIOR are always two sections of the same thing. SUPERIOR I, INFERIOR I, are two sections of the same EGO.</p>\n<p>The DIVINE BEING, the MONAD, the INTIMATE, has nothing to do with any form of the I. THE BEING is the BEING and that is all. The Reason for BEING is the BEING itself.</p>\n<p>The PERSONALITY in itself is only a vehicle and nothing more. Through the personality the EGO or the BEING can manifest, it all depends on ourselves.</p>\n<p>IT IS URGENT to dissolve the I, the EGO, so that only the PSYCHOLOGICAL ESSENCE of our TRUE BEING is manifested through our PERSONALITY.</p>\n<p>It is essential that EDUCATORS fully understand the need to cultivate the three aspects of the HUMAN PERSONALITY harmoniously.</p>\n<p>A perfect balance between personality and ESSENCE, a harmonious development of THOUGHT, EMOTION and MOVEMENT, a REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS, constitute the foundations of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.</p>"
