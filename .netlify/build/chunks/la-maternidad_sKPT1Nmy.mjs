    "set:html": "<p>Human life begins as a simple cell subject, as is natural, to the extraordinarily rapid time of living cells.</p>\n<p>Conception, gestation, birth, it is always the wonderful and formidable trio with which the life of any creature begins.</p>\n<p>It is truly surprising to know that our first moments of existence must be lived in the infinitely small, each of us transformed into a simple microscopic cell.</p>\n<p>We begin to exist in the form of an insignificant cell and end life old, elderly and burdened with memories.</p>\n<p>The self is memory. Many elderly people do not remotely live in the present, many old people live only remembering the past. Every old man is no more than a voice and a shadow. Every elderly person is a ghost of the past, accumulated memory and this is what continues in the genes of our descendants.</p>\n<p>Human conception begins with extraordinarily rapid times, but through the different processes of life they become slower and slower.</p>\n<p>Many readers should remember the relativity of time. The insignificant insect that only lives a few hours on a summer afternoon, seems as if it hardly lives, but it really lives everything that a man lives in eighty years, what happens is that it lives quickly, a man lives in eighty years everything that a planet lives in millions of years.</p>\n<p>When the spermatozoon joins with the egg, gestation begins. The cell with which human life begins contains forty-eight chromosomes.</p>\n<p>Chromosomes are divided into genes, a hundred or so of the latter certainly constitute what a chromosome is.</p>\n<p>Genes are very difficult to study because each one is made up of a few molecules that vibrate with inconceivable speed.</p>\n<p>The wonderful world of genes constitutes an intermediate zone between the three-dimensional world and the world of the fourth dimension.</p>\n<p>In the genes are found the atoms of heredity. The psychological self of our ancestors comes to impregnate the fertilised egg.</p>\n<p>In this era of electro-technology and atomic science, it is by no means an exaggeration to affirm that the electro-magnetic trace left by an ancestor who exhaled his last breath has been imprinted on the genes and chromosomes of the egg fertilised by a descendant.</p>\n<p>The path of life is formed with the footprints of the hooves of the horse of death.</p>\n<p>During the course of existence, different types of energy flow through the human organism; each type of energy has its own system of action, each type of energy manifests itself at its own time and hour.</p>\n<p>At two months of conception we have the digestive function and at four months of conception the driving force comes into action, so intimately related to the respiratory and muscular systems.</p>\n<p>The scientific spectacle of the birth and death of all things is wonderful.</p>\n<p>Many wise men affirm that there is an intimate analogy between the birth of the human creature and the birth of worlds in outer space.</p>\n<p>At nine months the child is born, at ten begins growth with all its wonderful metabolisms and the symmetrical and perfect development of the connective tissues.</p>\n<p>When the frontal fontanelle of newborns closes at two or three years of age, it is a sign that the brain-spinal system has been perfectly completed.</p>\n<p>Many scientists have said that nature has imagination and that this imagination gives living form to all that is, to all that has been, to all that will be.</p>\n<p>Many people laugh at imagination and some even call it the “MADWOMAN OF THE HOUSE”.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of confusion around the word IMAGINATION and many confuse IMAGINATION with FANTASY.</p>\n<p>Certain wise men say that there are two imaginations. The first is called MECHANICAL IMAGINATION and the second INTENTIONAL IMAGINATION: The first is made up of the waste products of the mind and the second corresponds to the most worthy and decent thing we have inside.</p>\n<p>Through observation and experience we have been able to verify that there is also a type of SUB-IMAGINATION MECHANICAL MORBID INFRACONSCIOUS and SUBJECTIVE.</p>\n<p>This type of AUTOMATIC SUB-IMAGINATION works below the INTELLECTUAL ZONE.</p>\n<p>Erotic images, morbid films, spicy stories with double meaning, morbid jokes, etc., usually put the MECHANICAL SUB-IMAGINATION to work unconsciously.</p>\n<p>In-depth analysis has led us to the logical conclusion that erotic dreams and nocturnal pollutions are due to MECHANICAL SUB-IMAGINATION.</p>\n<p>ABSOLUTE CHASTITY is impossible as long as MECHANICAL SUB-IMAGINATION exists.</p>\n<p>It is perfectly clear that CONSCIOUS IMAGINATION is radically different from what is called MECHANICAL IMAGINATION, SUBJECTIVE, INFRACONSCIOUS. SUBCONSCIOUS.</p>\n<p>Any representation can be perceived in a SELF-ENHANCING and dignifying way, but the SUB-IMAGINATION of a mechanical, infraconscious, subconscious, unconscious type can betray us by functioning automatically with nuances and sensual, passionate, submerged images.</p>\n<p>If we want INTEGRAL, uni-total, in-depth CHASTITY, we need to monitor not only CONSCIOUS IMAGINATION, but also MECHANICAL IMAGINATION and UNCONSCIOUS, AUTOMATIC, SUBCONSCIOUS, SUBMERGED SUB-IMAGINATION.</p>\n<p>We must never forget the intimate relationship between SEX and IMAGINATION.</p>\n<p>Through in-depth meditation we must transform all types of mechanical imagination and all forms of AUTOMATIC SUB-IMAGINATION and INFRA-IMAGINATION, into CONSCIOUS, objective IMAGINATION.</p>\n<p>OBJECTIVE IMAGINATION is in itself essentially creative, without it the inventor could not have conceived the telephone, the radio, the airplane, etc.</p>\n<p>The IMAGINATION of the WOMAN in a state of pregnancy is fundamental for the development of the foetus. It has been shown that every mother can alter the psyche of the foetus with her IMAGINATION.</p>\n<p>It is urgent that the woman in a state of pregnancy contemplate beautiful paintings, sublime landscapes, and listen to classical music and harmonious words, so she can operate on the psyche of the creature she carries in her womb harmoniously.</p>\n<p>The woman in a state of pregnancy should not drink alcohol, or smoke, or contemplate the ugly, the unpleasant because all this is harmful to the harmonious development of the creature.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to know how to excuse all the whims and errors of the pregnant woman.</p>\n<p>Many intolerant men lacking true understanding get angry and insult the woman in a state of pregnancy. The bitterness of this, the afflictions caused by the husband lacking in quality, have repercussions on the foetus in a state of gestation, not only physically but psychically.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the power of creative imagination, it is logical to affirm that the woman in a state of pregnancy should not contemplate the ugly, the unpleasant, the inharmonious, the disgusting, etc.</p>\n<p>The time has come for governments to worry about solving the great problems related to motherhood.</p>\n<p>It is incongruous that in a society that prides itself on being Christian and democratic, the religious sense of motherhood is not respected and venerated. It is monstrous to see thousands of women in a state of pregnancy without any protection, abandoned by their husbands and society, begging for a piece of bread or a job and often exercising harsh material work, to be able to survive with the creature they carry in their womb.</p>\n<p>These subhuman states of current society, this cruelty and lack of responsibility of rulers and peoples are clearly indicating to us that democracy does not yet exist.</p>\n<p>Hospitals with their maternity wards have not yet solved the problem, because women can only reach these hospitals when childbirth is approaching.</p>\n<p>There is an urgent need for collective homes, true garden cities equipped with halls and residences for women in a state of pregnancy who are desperately poor, clinics and kindergartens for their children.</p>\n<p>These collective homes, which are accommodation for desperately poor women in a state of pregnancy, full of all kinds of comforts, flowers, music, harmony, beauty, etc., would completely solve the great problem of motherhood.</p>\n<p>We must understand that human society is a large family and that there is no foreign problem because every problem in one way or another affects all members of society within their respective circle. It is absurd to discriminate against pregnant women for the fact of being desperately poor. It is criminal to underestimate them, despise them or confine them to an asylum for the destitute.</p>\n<p>In this society in which we live there cannot be children and stepchildren, because we are all human and we have the same rights.</p>\n<p>We need to create true democracy, if we really do not want to be devoured by communism.</p>"
