This is the introductory level to Gnostic Philosophical Studies or external degrees of gnosis. It is natural that all students will start with this level and then continue, successively, with the first, second, third levels, etc. It should be kept very much in mind that these are not the Gnostic esoteric degrees. The Gnostic esoteric degrees are received by the student when they are prepared for them. The esoteric degrees, which are the authentic Gnostic degrees, cannot be disclosed by anyone who has received them; this is forbidden. Anyone who says: "I have so many degrees, so many initiations," is dishonest.

If a person wants to be an engineer, lawyer or doctor, etc., they have to prepare for it. That person will go to school and study hard. After possessing a good theoretical knowledge of the branch they are studying, they will then begin the practice of what they have learned. Practice brings perfection. The great sages, the great professionals, the great scientists, etc., have not only come to possess a good theoretical knowledge of their respective branches of study, but have put this knowledge into practice. Theory alone cannot bring anything (except an intellectual enjoyment on the part of those who understand it). Practice is needed.

Study this course of lessons and study it with real incentive, with the desire to learn, with the desire to know the higher wisdom. But remember that you have to put what you have learned into practice, if you want to reach the perfection of the Work.
