There are two bodies of doctrine, the doctrine of the eye and the doctrine of the heart, there is external and internal or introspective knowledge, intellective or lective knowledge and conscious or lived knowledge. Lective or intellective knowledge serves for coexistence and to obtain our sustenance. Introspective and conscious knowledge, or knowledge of our consciousness, leads us to divine knowledge which is very important, because the knower must know himself.

Five external senses allow us the knowledge that is called materialistic and seven internal senses allow us to know what is called esoteric or occult, these senses are: seeing, clairvoyance, polyvision, hidden hearing, intuition, telepathic and remembrance of past lives. Their organs are: pineal gland, pituitary gland (glands in the brain), thyroid (the Adam's apple), the heart and the solar plexus or epigastrium (above the navel); through these we know seven (7) bodies of man: Physical, vital, astral, mental, which constitute the four bodies of sin that are lunar protoplasmic and three more that are bodies of the will, of the soul and of the spirit, which enrich consciousness knowledge, this knowledge is alive because we make it vivid, it constitutes what religious and philosophers call the soul.

If we improve the senses, we improve our knowledge. The senses are improved when we get rid of our defects, if we are liars our senses are liars, if we are rogues, our senses are too.

In this culture we have to return our defects to improve our informants or senses. Know friend the Gnostic culture which teaches us the Fundamental Education that covers from conception to sublime old age.
