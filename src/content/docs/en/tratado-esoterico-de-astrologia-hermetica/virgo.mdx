AUGUST 22ND TO SEPTEMBER 23RD

PRAKRITI is the DIVINE MOTHER, the PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE of nature.

In the Universe there are several substances, different elements and sub-elements, but all these are different modifications of a UNIQUE SUBSTANCE.

PRIMORDIAL MATTER is PURE AKASHA contained in all space, the GREAT MOTHER, PRAKRITI.

MAHANVANTARA and PRALAYA are two very important SANSKRIT terms with which GNOSTIC students should familiarise themselves.

MAHANVANTARA is the GREAT COSMIC DAY. PRALAYA is the GREAT COSMIC NIGHT. During the GREAT DAY the universe exists. When the GREAT NIGHT arrives, the universe ceases to exist, it dissolves into the bosom of PRAKRITI.

The immeasurable infinite space is full of SOLAR SYSTEMS that have their MAHANVANTARAS and their PRALAYAS.

While some are in MAHANVANTARA, others are in PRALAYA.

Millions and billions of UNIVERSES are born and die within the bosom of PRAKRITI.

Every COSMOS is born from PRAKRITI and dissolves into PRAKRITI. Every world is a ball of fire that ignites and extinguishes within the bosom of PRAKRITI.

Everything is born from PRAKRITI, everything returns to PRAKRITI. She is the GREAT MOTHER.

The BHAGAVAD GITA says: "The GREAT PRAKRITI is MY matrix, there I place the germ and from it, O Bharata!, all beings are born."

"O Kountreya!, PRAKRITI is the true matrix of anything that is born of different matrices, and I am the paternal germinator."

"SATTVA, RAJO and TAMO, these three GUNAS (aspects or qualities), born of PRAKRITI, O you of mighty arms!, strongly bind the body to the incarnate being."

"Of these, SATTVA, which is pure, luminous and good, binds the incarnate being!, O impeccable one!, through attachment to happiness and knowledge."

"O KOUNTREYA!, know that RAYAS is of a passionate nature and is the source of DESIRE and attachment; this GUNA strongly binds the incarnate being to action."

O Bharata!, know that TAMO is born of ignorance and hallucinates all beings; he binds the incarnate being through inadvertence, laziness and sleep." (SLEEPING CONSCIOUSNESS, DREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.)

During the GREAT PRALAYA these THREE GUNAS are in perfect equilibrium on the GREAT BALANCE of JUSTICE; when the imbalance of the three GUNAS occurs, the dawn of the MAHANVANTARA begins and the UNIVERSE is born from the bosom of the PRAKRITI.

During the GREAT PRALAYA, PRAKRITI is UNITOTAL, INTEGRAL. In the MANIFESTATION, in the MAHANVANTARA, PRAKRITI differentiates into THREE COSMIC ASPECTS.

The three aspects of PRAKRITI during MANIFESTATION are: First, that of INFINITE SPACE; Second, that of NATURE; Third, that of MAN.

The DIVINE MOTHER, in infinite space; the DIVINE MOTHER in NATURE; the DIVINE MOTHER in man. These are the THREE MOTHERS; the THREE MARIAS OF CHRISTIANITY.

GNOSTIC students must understand these three aspects of PRAKRITI very well, as this is fundamental in ESOTERIC work. In addition, it is URGENT to know that PRAKRITI has its particularity in each man.

GNOSTIC students should not be surprised if we affirm that the particular PRAKRITI of each man even has its individual name. This means that each of us also has a DIVINE MOTHER. Understanding this is FUNDAMENTAL to ESOTERIC WORK.

SECOND BIRTH is something else. The THIRD LOGOS, the SACRED FIRE, must first make the sacred womb of the DIVINE MOTHER fertile, then comes the SECOND BIRTH.

She, the PRAKRITI, is always VIRGIN, before childbirth, during childbirth and after childbirth.

In the eighth chapter of this book we will deal in depth with the practical work related to the SECOND BIRTH. Now we only give some guiding ideas.

Every MASTER of the WHITE LODGE has his divine mother, particular, his PRAKRITI.

Every MASTER is the son of an immaculate virgin. If we study comparative religions, we will discover immaculate conceptions everywhere; JESUS is conceived by the work and grace of the HOLY SPIRIT, the MOTHER of JESUS was an IMMACULATE VIRGIN.

Religious Scriptures say that BUDDHA, JUPITER, ZEUS, APOLLO, QUETZALCOATL, FUJI, LAOTSE, etc., etc., were sons of IMMACULATE VIRGINS, virgins before childbirth, during childbirth and after childbirth.

In the sacred land of the VEDAS, DEVAKI, the HINDUSTAN VIRGIN conceived KRISHNA and in BETHLEHEM the VIRGIN MARY conceives JESUS.

In YELLOW CHINA, on the banks of the FUJI river, the VIRGIN HO-AE steps on the sole of the GREAT MAN, a marvellous glow covers her and her womb conceives by the work and grace of the HOLY SPIRIT the CHINESE CHRIST FUJI.

It is a basic condition for the SECOND BIRTH that the THIRD LOGOS, the HOLY SPIRIT, first intervenes, fertilising the VIRGINAL WOMB of the DIVINE MOTHER.

The SEXUAL FIRE of the THIRD LOGOS in HINDUSTAN is known by the name of KUNDALINI and is symbolised by a serpent of burning fire.

The DIVINE MOTHER is ISIS, TONANTZIN, KALI or PARVATI, the wife of SHIVA, the THIRD LOGOS and her most powerful symbol is the SACRED COW.

The serpent must ascend through the medullary canal of the SACRED COW, the serpent must make the womb of the DIVINE MOTHER fertile, only then comes the immaculate conception and the SECOND BIRTH.

The KUNDALINI, in itself, is a SOLAR fire that is enclosed within a MAGNETIC centre located in the coccyx bone, the base of the spine.

When the sacred fire awakens, it ascends through the medullary canal along the spine, opening the seven centres of the spine and fertilising the PRAKRITI.

The FIRE of the KUNDALINI has seven degrees of power and it is necessary to ascend this septenary scale of FIRE to achieve the second birth.

When the PRAKRITI becomes fertile with the flaming fire, she has formidable powers to help us.

To be BORN again is equivalent to ENTERING the KINGDOM. It is very rare to find someone who is twice born. Rare is he who is BORN for the SECOND TIME.

Whoever wants to be BORN again, whoever wants to achieve FINAL LIBERATION, must eliminate the THREE GUNAS of PRAKRITI from his nature.

Whoever does not eliminate the GUNA SATTVA, gets lost in the labyrinth of THEORIES and abandons the ESOTERIC WORK.

Whoever does not eliminate RAYAS, fortifies the LUNAR EGO through ANGER, GREED, LUST.

We must not forget that RAYAS is the very ROOT of animal desire and the most violent passions.

RAYAS is the ROOT of all concupiscence. The latter, in itself, is the origin of all desire.

Whoever wants to eliminate DESIRE, must first eliminate the GUNA RAYAS.

Whoever does not eliminate TAMO, will always have a sleeping CONSCIOUSNESS, will be lazy, will abandon the ESOTERIC WORK, because of laziness, inertia, sloth, lack of will, lukewarmness, lack of spiritual enthusiasm, will be a victim of the foolish illusions of this world and will succumb to ignorance.

It is said that after death, people of SATTVIC temperament go on vacation to the paradises or molecular and electronic KINGDOMS where they enjoy infinite bliss before RETURNING to a new matrix.

The INITIATED know very well, from direct experience, that people of RAYASIC temperament REINCORPORATE or RETURN to this world IMMEDIATELY or remain on the threshold awaiting the opportunity to enter a new matrix, but without having the joy of a vacation in the different KINGDOMS of happiness.

Every ILLUMINATED one knows with complete SECURITY that after death people of TAMOSIC temperament enter the HELL-WORLDS located by DANTE in his DIVINE COMEDY, under the crust of the earth within the bowels of the subterranean world.

It is URGENT to eliminate the three GUNAS from our inner nature, if we really want to successfully carry out the ESOTERIC WORK.

The BHAGAVAD GITA says: "When the wise man sees that only the GUNAS are the ones that act, and knows the ONE who is beyond the GUNAS, then he comes to my BEING."

Many would like a technique to eliminate the three GUNAS, we affirm that only by DISSOLVING the LUNAR EGO can the three GUNAS be successfully eliminated.

He who remains indifferent and is not disturbed by the GUNAS, who has realised that only the GUNAS function, and remains firm without wavering, is because he has already DISSOLVED the LUNAR EGO.

He who feels the same in pleasure or in pain, who dwells in his own BEING; who gives equal value to a lump of clay to a pebble or to a nugget of gold; who remains equanimous in the face of the pleasant and the unpleasant, in the face of censure or praise, in honour or in dishonour, in the face of friend or enemy and who has renounced all new EGOISTIC and earthly enterprise, is because he has already eliminated the THREE GUNAS and DISSOLVED the LUNAR EGO.

He who no longer has concupiscence, who has extinguished the fire of LUST in all forty-nine SUBCONSCIOUS departments of the mind, has eliminated the THREE GUNAS and dissolved the LUNAR EGO.

"Earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect and EGO, are the eight categories into which my PRAKRITI is divided." Thus it is written, these are the words of the blessed one.

"When the GREAT COSMIC DAY dawns, all beings manifest themselves proceeding from the UNMANIFESTED PRAKRITI; and at sunset, they disappear in the same UNMANIFESTED one."

Behind the UNMANIFESTED PRAKRITI is the UNMANIFESTED ABSOLUTE. It is necessary to enter first into the UNMANIFESTED before immersing ourselves within the BOSOM of the UNMANIFESTED ABSOLUTE.

The Blessed GODDESS MOTHER OF THE WORLD is that which is called LOVE. She is ISIS, whose veil no mortal has lifted; in the flame of the SERPENT we adore her.

All the GREAT RELIGIONS worshipped the COSMIC MOTHER; she is ADONIA, INSOBERTA, REA, CYBELE, TONANTZIN, etc., etc., etc.

The DEVOTEE of the VIRGIN MOTHER can ask; the sacred scriptures say: Ask and it shall be given to you, knock and it shall be opened to you.

In the GREAT WOMB of the DIVINE MOTHER the worlds gestate. VIRGO governs the WOMB.

Virgo is very intimately related to the intestines and especially to the Pancreas and the ISLETS of LARGEHANS that secrete INSULIN so important for the digestion of sugars.

The forces that rise from the earth, upon reaching the womb, are charged with adrenal hormones that prepare and purify them for their ascent to the heart.

During this sign of VIRGO (THE CELESTIAL VIRGIN), we, lying on our backs with our body relaxed, must give the womb small jumps, with the purpose that the forces that rise from the earth, are charged in the womb with the adrenal hormones.

The GNOSTIC student must understand the importance of that boiler called the stomach and put an end forever to the vice of gluttony.

The disciples of the lord BUDDHA only maintain themselves with one good meal a day.

Fish and fruits constitute the main food of the inhabitants of the planet VENUS.

In grains and vegetables of all kinds, there are wonderful vital principles.

Sacrificing CATTLE, cows, bulls, is a horrible crime typical of these people and this LUNAR race.

In the world there have always existed two Races in eternal conflict, the SOLAR and the LUNAR.

ABRAHAM, IA-SAC, IA-CAB, IO-SEP, were always worshippers of the SACRED COW, IO, or, of the EGYPTIAN GODDESS IS-IS; while Moses, or rather the REFORMER ESDRAS who altered the teachings of Moses, demand the SACRIFICE of the COW and the calf and that their blood fall on the head of all, especially their children.

The SACRED COW is the symbol of the DIVINE MOTHER, ISIS, whose veil no mortal has lifted.

The TWICE BORN form the SOLAR RACE, the SOLAR PEOPLE. The PEOPLE of the SOLAR RACE would never murder a SACRED COW. The twice BORN are children of the SACRED COW.

EXODUS, chapter XXIX, is pure and legitimate BLACK MAGIC. In said chapter, unjustly attributed to MOSES, the ritual ceremony of the sacrifice of cattle is described in detail.

The LUNAR RACE mortally hates the SACRED COW. The SOLAR RACE adores the SACRED COW.

H.P.B., really saw a COW with FIVE LEGS. The fifth leg came out of her hump, with it she scratched herself, scared away the flies, etc.

Such a cow was led by a young man of the SADHU Sect, in the lands of HINDUSTAN.

The SACRED COW OF FIVE LEGS is the GUARDIAN of the lands and temples of JINAS; the PRAKRITI, the DIVINE MOTHER, developed in the SOLAR MAN, the power that allows us to enter the LANDS OF JINAS, in its palaces, in its temples, in the GARDENS OF THE GODS.

The only thing that separates us from the land of JINAS enchantments and wonders is a GREAT STONE that we must know how to run.

The KABALA is the SCIENCE of the COW; reading the three syllables of KABALA in reverse, we have LA-VA-CA.

The STONE of KABA in MECCA read in reverse COW or the STONE of the COW.

The GREAT SANCTUARY OF KABA is really the SANCTUARY OF THE COW. The PRAKRITI in man becomes fertile with the sacred fire and becomes the SACRED COW with five legs.

SURA 68 of the KORAN is wonderful; in it, the members of the COW are spoken of as something extraordinary, capable of resurrecting even the dead, that is, the LUNAR men (INTELLECTUAL ANIMALS), to lead them to the PRIMITIVE LIGHT of the SOLAR RELIGION.

We, the GNOSTICS, adore the SACRED COW, we worship the DIVINE MOTHER.

With the help of the SACRED COW OF FIVE LEGS, we can enter with a physical body in a state of JINAS inside the TEMPLES of the GODS.

If the student meditates deeply on the COW OF FIVE LEGS, on the DIVINE MOTHER and begs her to put his physical body in a state of JINAS, he can triumph.

The important thing is to get out of bed afterwards without losing sleep, like a sleepwalker.

Putting the PHYSICAL BODY inside the FOURTH DIMENSION is something extraordinary, something wonderful, and this is only possible with the help of the SACRED COW of five legs.

We need to fully develop the SACRED COW within ourselves to perform wonders and prodigies of JINAS science.

The DIVINE MOTHER is very close to her son, she is within the INTIMATE itself of each one of us and to her, precisely to her, we must ask for help in the difficult moments of existence.

There are three kinds of food: SATTVIC, RAYASIC and TAMASIC. SATTVIC foods are constituted by flowers, grains, fruits and that which is called LOVE.

RAYASIC foods are strong, passionate, excessively spicy, too salty, excessively sweet, etc.

TAMASIC foods are actually constituted by blood and red meat, they have no LOVE, they are bought and sold or offered with vanity, pride and arrogance.

Eat what is necessary to live, neither too little, nor in excess, drink pure water, bless the food.

VIRGO is the zodiacal sign of the VIRGIN MOTHER of the WORLD, it is the house of MERCURY, its minerals are JASPER and EMERALD.

In practice we have been able to verify that the natives of VIRGO are unfortunately very reasonable in excess, beyond normal and sceptical by nature.

Reason, intellect, are very necessary, but when they go out of their orbit, they are then detrimental.

The natives of VIRGO are useful for science, psychiatry, medicine, naturism, the laboratory, pedagogy, etc., etc., etc.

The natives of VIRGO cannot understand each other with the people of PISCES and therefore we advise them to avoid marriages with Piscian people.

The most regrettable thing about the people of VIRGO is that inertia and scepticism that characterises them. However, it is interesting to know that this tense inertia tends to pass from the material to the spiritual, as far as it is accessible through experience.

The CRITICAL-ANALYTICAL talent of VIRGO is formidable and among the GREAT GENIUSES of this sign is GOETHE, who managed to transcend the material, the inertia and enter into high scientific spirituality.

However, all the natives of VIRGO are NOT GOETHE. Commonly, among the mediocre of this sign, there abound ATHEIST MATERIALISTS, enemies of everything that smells of SPIRITUALITY.

The EGOISM of the MEDIOCRE people of VIRGO, is something too grotesque and disgusting, but the GOETHE of VIRGO are genial, highly altruistic and deeply disinterested.

The natives of VIRGO suffer in love and go through great deceptions, because VENUS, the star of love, in VIRGO is in exile.
