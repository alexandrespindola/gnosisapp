## FOREWORD

### BY MASTER GARGHA KUICHINES

There is Scientific or Numerical Astrology that requires extensive study to learn, with which Astrologers of all time have made predictions about important events. Great figures have also made use of this knowledge, such as Hitler in Germany, who used specialised Astrologers to guide them in their war attacks.

We Gnostics separate ourselves from that form of study, because with it man is a toy according to the predictions, defenceless before the signs that mark the different squares and passage of the stars, we know an astrology that teaches us to manipulate with the stars and thus we can avoid the events that the specialists of Numerical Astrology could predict for us. For this, it is necessary to change the lunar bodies with which we are born, for solar or luminous bodies, making use of the very root of the being, that is, of our own seed.

The enemy that prevents us from scaling divine knowledge is our Satanic Ego or Chief of legions that governs our physical body. The most perfect way to get rid of the Guardian of the Threshold as those of the left hand call it, is through the process of Initiation which for us Gnostics begins with the entrance to the sanctuaries or Lumisials, making use of the teachings that the Avatar of Aquarius "Samael Aun Weor" directs and promotes.

In the time when the Initiate Jesus gave his teachings to the devotees of the path he said: "I am the way, I am the truth, I am the life, there was at that time a great magician called Simon the Magician, full of powers and great riches, who manifested to his disciples: "If Jesus reached his father by his own merits, I Simon, will also reach my father by my own merits and what he did was to follow the left path, moving away from his beloved, this danger is always latent when the devotees of the path believe that they alone can transcend the path.

For those who for the first time come into contact with this wisdom, we inform you that six months of preliminary studies are required, studying the works of Samael Aun Weor and putting his knowledge into practice, then if he gives proof that he seeks to realise himself thoroughly, and wants a superior life, then, he is given entrance to the Lumisials through a process of special training.

When the devotee of the path is prepared for the probationary course, the first test that he has to pass is that of Guardian of the Threshold or confrontation with his own Satan who has been our guide and Master for many centuries. I remember that back in 1949, a disciple of the then Hierophant of Minor Mysteries Aun Weor, and after more than four months of absolute chastity was subjected to the test of the Guardian one day July 27. That beginner was in a solitary place, he was in the internal, but he did not know it, when he invoked the Guardian of the Threshold, he did not wait, that beginner said that he first felt a deathly chill, the time that was clear was becoming darker and darker, also increasing that cold and a nauseating smell that made him shudder with dread, he felt like running away, but the Christic force that he had already accumulated in his organism by means of the alchemical transmutation, Arcanum A. Z. F., gave him courage to remain in that undesirable place. Suddenly he saw coming towards him a beast with the figure of an ape, totally hairy, with horns on his forehead that shone and crackled when they moved, with a nose and mouth like a mule, and said to him: So you want to abandon me? Is that how you repay me for all that I have favoured you? Are you exchanging me for that man you don't know? And he answered him full of dread that he did abandon him, the beast lunged at him in an attitude of attack, the beginner conjured him, but it was of no use to him that weak conjuration of a weak and frightened man, but he remembered that he was a Chela of Christ and he conjured him in the name of Christ and thus he retreated a little, each time he lunged at him, he asked for protection from Christ and his beloved Masters and said to him: you can no longer be against me, I will defeat you and the beast retreated uttering threats of all kinds. The anxiety of that disciple was immense, because the Hierophant had left in the direction of another city and this required at least three days of absence, but upon his return he asked him and he replied: I congratulate you, you came out well from the first test with the Guardian of the Threshold, this being is your own Satan, you have served and fed him for many centuries, and how do I feed him?, Asked the fearful student and the Master replied, he feeds on your low passions, he is nourished by our low desires, morbid passions, fornication, adultery, brothels and dirty life, all this constitutes the merchants of the temple that Christ told us about, they trade with our own temple, now it is your turn with the whip of the will to take out of you all those merchants who had you enslaved to Satan, now it is your turn to defeat each one of them if you really want to free yourself from evil and take the white path.

Through this work we will be able to visit all the stellar geniuses, attending the heart temple of the stars, asking and working with the stellar angels, so that we are not toys of the circumstances, but first we have to expel the merchants from our own temple, we have to learn to manipulate on our own Altar. For this, the devotee attends the rituals of the Lumisials assiduously; there he learns to love and serve God above all things and his neighbour, he becomes familiar with those rituals and later he understands that all the information of the rite of worship has intimate relation with the living altar and discovers unconfessable wonders. The JACHIN and BOAZ of the altars are required for the management of his altar and the moment even comes when he learns to give the seven steps that are required to work consciously on the altar of the living God and in the presence of the blessed goddess.

With the doctrine of the resurrection we learn to kill the goat we carry inside and thus we will form with time the flock of the Paschal Lamb. Thus we free ourselves from the Lord of Time to live an infinite existence full of eternal happiness.
