## 21 APRIL TO 20 MAY

With Taurus being the ZODIAC SIGN that governs the CREATIVE LARYNX, that marvellous WOMB where the WORD, the VERB, is gestated, it is fitting that, BROADLY SPEAKING, we understand in this lesson the words of JOHN, when he said: "In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made."

There are seven orders of worlds, seven cosmos created with the power of the Word, with music, with sound.

The first COSMOS is submerged in the UNCREATED LIGHT of the ABSOLUTE.

The second order of worlds is constituted by all the worlds of infinite space.

The third order of worlds is the total sum of all the suns of starry space.

The fourth order of worlds is the Sun that illuminates us with all its laws and DIMENSIONS.

The fifth order of worlds is composed of all the planets of the solar system.

The sixth order of worlds is the Earth itself, with its seven dimensions and regions populated by infinite beings.

The seventh order of worlds is formed by those seven concentric spheres or INFERNAL WORLDS of the SUBMERGED MINERAL KINGDOM beneath the Earth's crust.

Music, the VERB, placed by the LOGOS in seven musical octaves, sustains the Universe firmly in its march.

First order of worlds, note DO. Second order of worlds, note SI. Third order of worlds, note LA. Fourth order of worlds, note SOL. Fifth order of worlds, note FA. Sixth order of worlds, note MI. Seventh order of worlds, note RE. Afterwards, everything returns to the ABSOLUTE with the note DO.

Without music, without the VERB, without the GREAT WORD, the marvellous existence of the SEVEN COSMOS would be impossible.

DO-RE-MI-FA-SOL-LA-SI. SI-LA-SOL-FA-MI-RE-DO. The seven notes of the GREAT SCALE OF THE CREATIVE VERB, resonate in all that is created, because in the beginning was the VERB.

The first order of worlds is wisely governed by the ONLY LAW, by the GREAT LAW. The second order of worlds is governed by THREE LAWS. The third order of worlds is governed by six laws. The fourth order of worlds is governed by twelve laws. The fifth order of worlds is governed by twenty-four laws. The sixth order of worlds is governed by forty-eight laws. The seventh order of worlds is governed by ninety-six laws.

When we speak of the WORD, we also speak of the sound of music, of the RHYTHMS, of the FIRE with its three beats of the MAHAVAN and the CHOTAVAN that sustain the UNIVERSE firmly in its march.

The PSEUDO-OCCULTISTS and PSEUDO-ESOTERICISTS, only mention the MICROCOSM, and the MACROCOSM, they only cite two orders of worlds, when in reality there are SEVEN COSMOS, seven orders of worlds sustained by the VERB, by the music, by the LUMINOUS and spermatic FIAT of the first instant.

Each of the SEVEN COSMOS is, without a doubt, a living organism that breathes, feels and lives.

From the ESOTERIC point of view, we can assure that all progress upwards is the result of an advance downwards. One cannot go up without going down. First one must go down and then up.

If we want to know a COSMOS, we must first know the two adjacent ones, the one above and the one below, because both determine all the vital circumstances and phenomena of the COSMOS that we want to study, to know.

Example: In this era when scientists are striving for the conquest of space, tremendous advances are being made, unfortunately small, in the atomic world.

The creation of the SEVEN COSMOS was only possible through the verb, through the word, through music.

Our GNOSTIC students must never forget what the three forces called FATHER-SON-HOLY SPIRIT are. These three forces constitute the SACRED TRIAMAZIKAMNO.

This is the SACRED AFFIRMATION, the SACRED NEGATION, the SACRED RECONCILIATION; the HOLY GOD, the HOLY FIRM, the HOLY IMMORTAL.

In electricity, these are the three poles POSITIVE-NEGATIVE-NEUTRAL. Without the concurrence of these three poles, all creation is impossible.

In GNOSTIC ESOTERIC Science, the THREE independent FORCES have the following names: SURP-OTHEOS; SURP-SKIROS; SURP-ATHANATOS. IMPULSING, AFFIRMATIVE, POSITIVE FORCE. NEGATIVE FORCE, FORCE OF NEGATION, FORCE OF RESISTANCE. RECONCILIATING FORCE, LIBERATING FORCE, NEUTRALISING FORCE.

These three forces in the RAY OF CREATION appear as three wills, three consciences, three units. Each of these three forces contains within ITSELF all the possibilities of the three. However, at their point of conjunction, each of them manifests only its principle: the positive, the negative or the neutral.

It is very interesting to see the three forces in action: they separate, move away and then REUNITE to form new trinities that originate worlds, new creations.

In the ABSOLUTE, the three forces are the UNIQUE LOGOS, the ARMY OF THE VOICE within the GREAT UNITY of life free in its movement.

THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF THE SACRED COMMON COSMIC TRIAMAZIKAMNO began with the sexual union of the word because in the beginning was the verb, and the verb was with GOD and the verb was God. Through him all things were made, and without him nothing that is made would have been made.

According to the SACRED LAW OF HEPTAPARAPARSHINOKH (THE LAW OF SEVEN), seven temples were established in the CHAOS for the construction of this solar system.

According to the SACRED LAW OF TRIAMAZIKAMNO (THE LAW OF THREE), the ELOHIM divided into three groups within each temple to sing according to the LITURGY OF FIRE.

The work of making PRAKRITI, that is, the CHAOS, the COSMIC MOTHER, the GREAT WOMB, fertile is always the work of the very sacred TEOMERSMALOGOS, the THIRD FORCE.

Within each temple the three groups were organised as follows; First, a PRIEST. Second, a PRIESTESS. Third: a neutral group of ELOHIM.

If we take into account that the ELOHIM are ANDROGYNOUS, then it is clear that they had to polarise at will in MASCULINE, FEMININE and NEUTRAL form, according to the SACRED COMMON COSMIC TRIAMAZIKAMNO.

The PRIEST and the PRIESTESS before the altar and on the ground floor of the temple, the ANDROGYNOUS choir of the ELOHIM.

The RITUALS OF FIRE were SUNG and the sexual union of the word made the GREAT WOMB of CHAOS fertile and the UNIVERSE was born.

The ANGELS create with the power of the word. The Larynx is the womb where the word is gestated.

We must AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS in the WORD, in the CREATIVE LARYNX, so that one day we too can pronounce the LUMINOUS AND SPERMATIC FIAT of the first instant.

CONSCIOUSNESS sleeps in our larynx, we are unconscious with the word, we need to become fully CONSCIOUS of the WORD.

They say that silence is golden. We say that there are criminal silences. It is as bad to speak when one should be silent, as it is to be silent when one should speak.

There are times when speaking is a crime, there are times when being silent is also another crime.

Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but lacking aroma, are the beautiful, but sterile words of one who does not act according to what he says.

But like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of aroma, are the beautiful and fruitful words of one who acts according to what he says.

It is urgent to put an end to the mechanical nature of the word, it is necessary to speak with precision, in a CONSCIOUS and timely manner. We need to become CONSCIOUS of the verb.

There is responsibility in words, and to judge with the verb is a sacrilege. No one has the right to judge anyone; it is absurd to slander one's neighbour; it is stupid to murmur about the lives of others.

Criminal words fall upon us sooner or later, like a thunderbolt of revenge. Slanderous, infamous words always return to the one who pronounced them, turned into stones that wound.

In other times, when human beings were not so mechanised by this false civilisation, the cowboys took the cattle to the stable singing in a delicious and simply natural way.

The BULL, the COW, the calf, are moved by music, correspond to the zodiac sign of TAURUS, the constellation of the verb, of music.

In the GREAT PURANIC ALLEGORY, the earth persecuted by PRITHU flees, transforming itself into a COW and taking refuge in BRAHAMA. But this BRAHAMA is the first Person of the Hindustan TRIMURTI. VACH, the COW is the second and VIRAH the DIVINE MAN, the calf, the KABIR, the LOGOS, is the third person.

BRAHAMA is the FATHER. The COW is the DIVINE MOTHER, the CHAOS; the CALF is the KABIR, the LOGOS.

FATHER, MOTHER, SON, that is the PURANIC TRIMURTI. The FATHER is WISDOM. THE MOTHER is LOVE, the SON is the LOGOS, the VERB.

The ASTRAL COW with five legs that Colonel Olcott physically believes he sees in front of the marvellous hypogeum of Karli; a strange and mysterious cow that a certain young miner sees in the Andes, as an exotic guardian of those treasures that the miners of his rancheria were looking for, represents the DIVINE MOTHER, REA, CIBELES, fully developed in the TRUE MAN, in the SELF-REALISED MASTER.

GAUTAMA the BUDDHA or GOTAMA, literally means the driver of the COW. Every BOYERO, every driver of the COW, can use the JAINO fire of the COW to enter the lands, palaces, temples and cities of JINAS.

With the power of the DIVINE MOTHER we can visit AGHARTI, the JINAS cities of the subterranean world.

TAURUS invites us to REFLECTION. Let us remember that MERCURY stole the COWS OF THE SUN.

TAURUS governs the CREATIVE LARYNX. It is urgent that the KUNDALINI flourish on our fertile lips made VERB, only then can we use the JAINO fire to enter the KINGDOM of the JINAS.

In this time of TAURUS we must bring LIGHT to our creative larynx with the purpose of preparing it for the advent of FIRE.

Let the disciple sit in a comfortable armchair; close his physical eyes so that nothing of this vain and foolish world distracts him, empty the mind, cast out of his mind all kinds of thoughts, desires, worries, etc. Imagine now that the LIGHT accumulated during ARIES in his chalice, in his head, passes with TAURUS to the creative larynx.

The devotee should sing the MANTRAM AUM. Open the mouth wide with the A, imagine that the LIGHT descends from the head to the larynx; vocalise the U, vividly imagining that the light floods the throat; the mouth should be well rounded to sing the U.

The last letter is the M, closing the lips, expelling or throwing out the breath with force as if eliminating the dross from the throat. This work is done by singing the powerful Mantram AUM four times.

In the THYROID GLAND that secretes biological iodine, is the magnetic centre of the MAGICAL EAR. With the practices of TAURUS, the MAGICAL EAR is developed, the power to listen to the cosmic symphonies, the music of the spheres, the RHYTHMS OF FIRE that sustain the seven cosmos according to the law of octaves.

The THYROID GLAND is located in the neck, in the creative larynx.

The THYROID GLAND is governed by VENUS and the PARATHYROIDS are governed by MARS.

TAURUS is the house of VENUS. The Stone of TAURUS is AGATE, the metal of this sign is COPPER.

In practice we have been able to show that TAUREANS should not marry people of AQUARIUS, because they fail inevitably, due to the incompatibility of characters.

The sign of TAURUS is fixed, of earth, tends to stability and as the sign of AQUARIUS is aerial, mobile revolutionary, it is clear that they are incompatible.

TAUREANS are like the ox, meek and hardworking, but when they become angry they are terrible like the BULL.

TAUREANS go through GREAT LOVE DISAPPOINTMENTS in their lives, they are reserved, conservative, they follow step by step, like the ox, along the path laid out.

TAUREANS are very sensitive, anger in TAUREANS is of slow growth and usually culminates in strong volcanic outbursts.

The mediocre type of TAURUS is usually very selfish, gluttonous, quarrelsome, passionate, irascible, proud.

The superior type of TAURUS is full of LOVE, loves classical music, Wisdom, works with joy for humanity, is very intelligent, understanding, faithful, sincere in friendship, good Father, good Mother, good friend, good brother, good citizen, etc.

The MYSTICAL GREATNESS of the MITRAIC BULL, not understood by the superficial people of this DARK era of the twentieth century, later degenerated into the cult of the GOLDEN CALF.

THE SACRED COW symbolises ISIS, the DIVINE MOTHER and her CALF represents MERCURY the MESSENGER of the GODS, the KABIR, the LOGOS.

The PLEIADES, the CABRILLAS or CELESTIAL COWS, are esoterically included in the sign of TAURUS; the latter seem to be seven, but in reality there are more than two thousand, with their Mayan nebulas, their main star ALCYONE, and their companions ATLAS, TAIGETE, etc.

Around the reddish eye of TAURUS or ALDEBARAN, the only one that with ANTARES, heart of SCORPIO, can compete in colour with MARS, are grouped in an extraordinary and wonderful way the telescopic HYADES, another CELESTIAL CATTLE.

After TAURUS comes the gigantic ORION. Above and to the North of the CONSTELLATION OF TAURUS, there is this celestial group, symbolic of KING CEPHEUS, ZEPHYRUS OR ZEPHYR, of Queen Cassiopeia; of the Liberator Perseus with the head of Medusa in his hands and Andromeda, the liberated; while in front has come the whale surrounded by PISCES and AQUARIUS.

The panorama of TAURUS and its neighbouring sidereal regions is truly astonishing.
