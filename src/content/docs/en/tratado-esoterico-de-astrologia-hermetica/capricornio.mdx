21 DECEMBER TO 20 JANUARY

The BEING, the INTIMATE, the MONAD, has two SOULS; the first is the SPIRITUAL SOUL. The first is DANTE's BEATRICE, the BELLA HELENA, the SHULAMITE of WISE SOLOMON, the ineffable adorable spouse, the BUDDHI of THEOSOPHY.

The second is the HUMAN SOUL, the CAUSAL principle, the NOBLE SPOUSE, the SUPERIOR MANAS of THEOSOPHY.

Even though it seems strange and odd; while the HUMAN SOUL works, the SPIRITUAL SOUL plays.

ADAM and EVE are INTEGRATED within the MONAD and its KABALISTIC VALUE is 10 which reminds us of the IO, that is to say, of the vowels Iiiiiii. Ooooooo. The most sacred union of the ETERNAL MASCULINE with the ETERNAL FEMININE, the INTEGRATION of opposites within the ESSENTIAL and DIVINE MONAD.

The DIVINE TRIAD ATMAN-BUDDHI-MANAS, the BEING, we already said and we will repeat it again, that in common and current INTELLECTUAL ANIMALS, it is NEITHER BORN, NOR DIES, NOR REINCARNATES.

Beyond any doubt we can and must affirm, that only a FRACTION of the HUMAN SOUL lives within the LUNAR BODIES, this is the ESSENCE, the PSYCHIC material to ELABORATE SOUL, to develop HUMAN SOUL and in the background the SPIRITUAL SOUL.

The MONAD, the BEING, creates, manufactures, develops its TWO SOULS and these must serve and obey it.

We must distinguish between MONADS and SOULS. A MONAD, that is to say, a SPIRIT is ITSELF; a SOUL is had.

Distinguish between the MONAD of a WORLD and the SOUL of a WORLD; between the MONAD of a MAN and the SOUL of a MAN; between the MONAD of an ANT and the SOUL of an ANT.

The HUMAN ORGANISM in the last synthesis is composed of billions and trillions of infinitesimal MONADS.

There are various classes and orders of primary elements of all existence, of all organisms, by way of GERMS of all the phenomena of nature, to these we can call them MONADS using the term of LEIBNITZ, for lack of another more expressive to indicate the simplicity of the simplest existence.

To each of these GERMS or MONADS, corresponds an ATOM as a vehicle of action.

The MONADS attract each other, combine, transform, give form to every organism, to every world, to every micro-organism, etc.

Among the MONADS there are HIERARCHIES; the inferior MONADS have to obey the SUPERIOR ONES, that is LAW. The INFERIOR MONADS belong to the SUPERIOR ONES.

All the trillions of MONADS that animate the human organism have to obey the owner, the chief, the main MONAD.

The REGULATING MONAD, the PRIMORDIAL MONAD allows the activity of all its subordinates within the human organism, until the time indicated by the law of KARMA.

When billions or trillions of MONADS or VITAL GERMS abandon the PHYSICAL BODY, DEATH is then inevitable.

The MONADS are in THEMSELVES INDESTRUCTIBLE, they abandon their old connections to carry out shortly new ones.

The RETURN to THIS WORLD, the RE-ENTRY, the REINCORPORATION would be impossible without the work of the MONADS. They reconstruct new CELLS with their perceptions and sensations, new organisms. When the PRIMORDIAL MONAD is totally DEVELOPED it can afford the luxury of using its Trillions of MONADS to create a world, a SUN, a comet and thus become the REGULATING MONAD of ANY STAR, but that is a matter for GODS.

The MONADS or VITAL GERMS are not exclusive to the physical organism, within the ATOMS of the INTERNAL BODIES there are imprisoned many orders and categories of LIVING MONADS. The existence of any physical or suprasensible body, Angelic or Diabolical, Solar or Lunar, has as its foundation the billions and trillions of MONADS.

The LUNAR EGO in ITSELF is a compound of ATOMS of the secret enemy. Unfortunately, within these ATOMS are imprisoned the MONADS or VITAL GERMS.

Now we will understand why occult science says: "THE DEMON IS GOD IN REVERSE".

To each ATOM corresponds a VITAL GERM, a MONAD. All the infinite modifications, all the innumerable transformations, are the result of the varied combinations of the MONADS.

Nature deposits in the THREE BRAINS of the human being a certain capital of VITAL VALUES, when these are exhausted, death is inevitable.

The Three Brains are: 1-THE INTELLECTUAL CENTRE. 2-THE EMOTIONAL CENTRE. 3-MOVEMENT CENTRE.

After the death of the PHYSICAL BODY the EGO dressed with its LUNAR BODIES, continues in the molecular world.

Three things go to the cemetery, to the sepulchre.1-THE PHYSICAL BODY.2-THE VITAL BODY.3-THE PERSONALITY.

The vital body floats near the sepulchre and is disintegrated as the physical body is disintegrated, as its MONADS are freed.

The PERSONALITY is between the sepulchre, but it goes out when someone brings flowers, when some mourner visits it, it ambulates through the pantheon and returns to its sepulchre.

The Personality has a beginning and an end, it is slowly disintegrating in the cemetery.

PROSERPINA, the QUEEN of the HELL, is also HECATE, the BLESSED MOTHER GODDESS DEATH under whose direction the ANGELS of DEATH work.

The SPACE MOTHER converted into MOTHER-DEATH, loves her children dearly and that is why she takes them away.

The ANGELS of DEATH when they are working are dressed with their funeral clothes, they assume a spectral figure, they wield the sickle and with it they cut the silver cord that connects the INTERNAL BODIES with the PHYSICAL BODY.

The ANGELS of death cut the thread of life and take the EGO out of the physical body.

The Angels of Death are very wise and they develop and unfold under the RAY of SATURN.

The ANGELS OF DEATH not only know what is related to the common and current death of the PHYSICAL BODY, these MINISTERS OF DEATH are, in addition, profoundly WISE in everything related to the DEATH of the PLURALIZED I.

After the death of the body, the DISINCARNATE falls into a faint that lasts three and a half days.

THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD says: "You have been in a faint for the last three and a half days. As soon as you recover from this faint you will have the thought, what has happened? (for) at that moment all SAMSARA (PHENOMENAL UNIVERSE) will be in revolution.

The KABALISTIC VALUE of the EGO is FIFTY-SIX; this is the number of TYPHON, the MIND WITHOUT SPIRITUALITY.

The EGO takes its WORLDLINESS beyond the sepulchre of the physical body and the RETROSPECTIVE VISION of the life that has just passed is something very terrible.

After the GREAT FAINT of three and a half days, the deceased have to REVIVE SLOWLY in a retrospective way, all the life that has just passed.

The concept of TIME is something very important in this work of RETROSPECTIVE VISION of the life that has just passed or RETROSPECTIVE VISION of SAMSARA.

In the HELL-WORLDS all the scales of time are mineral, frightfully slow and oscillate between 80,000, 8,000, 800 and 80 years.

In this CELLULAR REGION in which we live gestation lasts TEN Lunar months; childhood One hundred Lunar months; life more or less, One thousand Lunar months.

In the Molecular World the events can be measured with a time scale that goes from a month to forty minutes.

In the ELECTRONIC WORLD the time scale oscillates between forty minutes and two and a half seconds.

The RETROSPECTIVE VISION OF SAMSARA (LIFE THAT HAS JUST PASSED), in the instant of death and during the three and a half days following, is of ELECTRONIC type and therefore each event can be measured with the ELECTRONIC time pattern.

The RETROSPECTIVE VISION OF SAMSARA in the MOLECULAR WORLD is less rapid and therefore each event is measured with the MOLECULAR TIME PATTERN.

The INTIMATE, the MONAD, the BEING with its TWO SOULS, before we were born in this vale of tears, DWELLS in the MILKY WAY and even during the life of the physical body here below, it continues living in the stars.

The fundamental thing for the ESSENCE after death is to reach the RELATIVE BUDDHIC STATE and the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION, this is only possible for the EMBRYO of SOUL that we have inside, going up, ascending to the ELECTRONIC WORLD.

It is URGENT TO KNOW that in the ELECTRONIC WORLD lives our DIVINE IMMORTAL TRIAD, our BEING, our BUDDHA.

To unite with the IMMORTAL TRIAD after death, to be one with it, means in fact to become a RELATIVE BUDDHA, to achieve the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION and to enjoy a beautiful vacation before returning to a new human organism.

If in the supreme moment of death, the CLEAR PRIMORDIAL LIGHT has been duly recognized by the deceased, it is a clear sign that he has reached the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION.

If in the supreme moment of death, the deceased only perceives the CLEAR SECONDARY LIGHT, it is a sign that he will have to struggle a lot to reach the RELATIVE BUDDHIC state.

The difficult thing for the ESSENCE is to UNCORK itself, to escape from its prison, to get out of the LUNAR BODIES, to abandon the PLURALIZED I. In this the KARMA of each one is definitive.

When the deceased has relived in a retrospective way all the life that has just passed, then he has to appear before the TRIBUNALS of KARMA to be judged.

The legend of ZOROASTER says: "Everyone whose good works exceed their sin by three grams, goes to heaven; everyone whose sin is greater, to hell, while everyone in whom both are equal, remains in the Hamistikan until the future body or resurrection.

Today, in these times of perversity and crude atheistic materialism, the majority of disincarnates enter after the Judgment to the submerged MINERAL KINGDOM, to the HELL-WORLDS.

There are also many millions who get into a new matrix immediately or mediately, without having given themselves the luxury of a good vacation in the SUPERIOR WORLDS.

Certainly the process of selection exists in all nature and few are those who achieve the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION and the RELATIVE BUDDHIC STATE.

The DISINCARNATED enter into ETERNITY under the influences of the MOON and leave ETERNITY through the doors of the MOON.

We already saw in the lesson of CANCER that the entire life of all people is processed under the influences of the MOON, MERCURY, VENUS, SUN, MARS, JUPITER and SATURN closing the life with a LUNAR brooch.

Really the MOON takes us and the MOON brings us and the seven types of planetary vibrations in their indicated classical order are repeated also after death, because AS IT IS ABOVE IS BELOW".

The essences that after being judged have the right to the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION and to the RELATIVE BUDDHIC STATE, need a certain type of very special ecstasy and a right constant effort to uncork themselves, to escape from the LUNAR BODIES and the EGO.

Fortunately, different groups of MASTERS assist the disincarnated and help them in this work with the RAYS of GRACE.

Just as in this cellular world in which we live there are Republics, Kingdoms, Presidents, Kings, Governors, etc., so also in the molecular world there are many Paradises, Regions and Kingdoms where the ESSENCES enjoy indescribable states of happiness.

The DISINCARNATED can enter into KINGDOMS of paradisiacal happiness such as: that of the DENSE CONCENTRATION; the KINGDOM of the LONG HAIR (VAJRAPANI); or the UNLIMITED VIHARA of the RADIATION OF THE LOTUS; (PADMA SAMBHAVA).

The DISINCARNATED that march towards the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION must help themselves, concentrating the mind in any of those KINGDOMS of the MOLECULAR WORLD.

It is really very painful to wander from life to life, to err through the horrible sewer of SAMSARA without enjoying the BUDDHIC STATE and the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION.

There are KINGDOMS of inconceivable happiness where the DISINCARNATED must strive to enter, let us remember the BLESSED KINGDOM of the WEST governed by the BUDDHA AMITABHA.

Let us remember the KINGDOM OF MAITREYA, the cycles of TUSHITA, to that KINGDOM of supreme bliss also can enter the DISINCARNATED that march towards the ELECTRONIC WORLD.

The DISINCARNATED must pray a lot to the GREAT COMPASSIONATE and to its DIVINE TRIAD, firm in its purposes, without letting itself be diverted by anything, if it is true that they do not want to fall into a new matrix without having enjoyed the INTERMEDIATE BUDDHIC STATE in the WORLD OF ELECTRONS.

The happiness in the ELECTRONIC regions, the INTERMEDIATE LIBERATION after having passed through the molecular paradises, is something impossible to describe with human words.

The BUDDHAS travel through the UNALTERABLE INFINITE among the indescribable symphonies of the worlds that palpitate within the bosom of MOTHER-SPACE.

However, every prize, every capital is exhausted. When the DHARMA of happiness is exhausted, the RETURN to a new matrix is then inevitable.

The ESSENCE loses the ECSTASY attracted by the LUNAR EGO and already bottled again between the LUNAR BODIES, RETURNS to a new matrix.

The instant in which the ESSENCE loses the ECSTASY is when it separates again from its INTIMATE BUDDHA to be bottled between the LUNAR BODIES and the PLURALIZED I.

The RETURN to a new matrix is carried out according to the LAW of KARMA.

The EGO continues in the descendants of its past or past lives.

The MONADS of its past PHYSICAL BODY have the power to gather atoms, molecules and reconstruct cells and organs; thus we return to this cellular world dressed with no new physical body.

The poor ANIMAL, common and current INTELLECTUAL begins its life in this world as a simple original cell, subject to the rapid time (of the cells and ends around seventy and eighty years or something more, loaded with memories and experiences of all kinds.

It is URGENT to know that in the process of RE-ENTRY or RETURN a certain SELECTION is also carried out.

The I is a SUM of small YOES and not all those small YOES RETURN to a new human organism.

The I is a SUM of distinct, diverse ENTITIES, without order of any kind and not all those ENTITIES RE-ENTER to a new human organism, many of those ENTITIES are REINCORPORATED in BODIES of HORSES, DOGS, CATS, PIGS, etc., etc., etc.

Once when the MASTER PYTHAGORAS was walking with a friend of his, this one had to hit a dog. The MASTER rebuked him saying: "DO NOT HIT IT, THAT IN ITS PITIFUL BARK I HAVE KNOWN THE VOICE OF A FRIEND OF MINE WHO DIED".

It is clear that upon reaching this part of our present chapter, the fanatics of the DOGMA of EVOLUTION will launch against us all their defamatory saliva and will protest saying: THE EGO CANNOT GO BACK, EVERYTHING EVOLVES, EVERYTHING MUST REACH PERFECTION, etc., etc., etc.

These FANATICS ignore that the EGO is a sum of small animal YOES and that like attracts like.

These FANATICS ignore that the EGO has nothing of DIVINE, it is a sum of ANIMAL ENTITIES that the LAW of EVOLUTION will never be able to lead to PERFECTION.

The ANIMAL ENTITIES have full right to enter into animal matrices of dogs, horses, pigs, etc., etc., etc., and that CANNOT be PROHIBITED by the FANATICS of the DOGMA OF EVOLUTION, even if they shout and curse and thunder and lightning.

This is the DOCTRINE of the METAMORPHOSIS or METEMPSYCHOSIS of PYTHAGORAS and it is based on the same Laws of Nature.

In the GOLDEN ASS of APULEIUS we find this DOCTRINE of PYTHAGORAS totally documented.

APULEIUS says that in the THESSALY of WITCHCRAFT the stones were but petrified men; the birds, men with wings; the trees, men with foliage; the fountains, human bodies that bled clear lymph. Admirable symbolic way of representing the undoubted fact for every occultist, that the DIVERSE ENTITIES that constitute the PLURALIZED I, can be reincorporated in organisms of beasts or enter into the MINERAL, VEGETABLE KINGDOM, etc., etc., etc.

The CHRISTIAN MYSTICS with just reason speak with love of the sister plant, the brother wolf, the sister stone.

RUDOLF STEINER the GERMAN INITIATE, says that in the POLAR EPOCH only MAN existed and that the animals existed later, they were inside MAN, they were eliminated by MAN.

Those ANIMALS were the different parts or ENTITIES of the PLURALIZED I of the ORIGINAL MEN. Those ENTITIES that were eliminated by them from their internal nature and that due to the PROTOPLASMATIC state of the earth in that epoch, marched towards the current physical crystallization.

Those POLAR and HYPERBOREAN MEN needed to eliminate those ANIMAL ENTITIES, that PLURALIZED I, to become TRUE MEN, SOLAR MEN.

Some subjects are so ANIMAL, that if everything they have of ANIMAL were taken away from them, nothing would remain.

SATURN is the PLANET of DEATH and is exalted in CAPRICORN. This sign is symbolized by a kid as to remind us of the GOAT SKIN, the INTELLECTUAL ANIMALS with GOAT skin, the need to eliminate what we have of ANIMAL in us, the ANIMAL ENTITIES that we carry inside.

The STONE of CAPRICORN is the BLACK ONYX and every black stone in general, the metal is LEAD and its day is SATURDAY.

On SATURDAY the WITCHES of the Middle Ages celebrated their horrible SABBATS, but also SATURDAY is the SEVENTH DAY so sacred for the JEWS. SATURN is LIFE and DEATH. The path of life is formed with the footprints of the hooves of the horse of death.

The magnetic currents that rise from the earth after passing through the sieves of the feet continue through the calves and upon reaching the knees they are loaded with the LEAD of SATURN, thus they acquire solidity, form, strength.

We are NOT talking about LEAD in its coarse state; we are talking about LEAD in a COLLOIDAL, subtle state.

The knees possess a marvellous substance that allows them the free movement of such a simple and marvellous bony gear. That substance is the famous SYNOVIA, which comes from the root SIN, which means WITH and OVIA, EGG. Total, SUBSTANCE WITH EGG.

The EGG is widely used in JINAS SCIENCE and we already talked about this in the ESOTERIC TREATISE of THEURGY, second EDITION.

CAPRICORN PRACTICE. During the sign of CAPRICORN imagine a coffin or dead box on the floor. Walk over that imaginary coffin, but imagining it in the centre of the legs; when walking you will bend the knees, as to save the obstacle, as to pass the legs over the coffin, but making the knees turn from right to left, with the mind concentrated on them, having the firm intention that they are loaded with the lead of SATURN.

The MASONIC MASTERS will be able to understand this practice of SATURN very well, because they are the same steps of the MASONIC MASTER upon entering the LODGE.

The natives of CAPRICORN have a disposition for pedagogy, they suffer a lot, they have a GREAT SENSE OF DUTY, they are practical by nature and they always go through great suffering in their lives, someone betrays them.

The women of CAPRICORN are magnificent wives, faithful until death, thrifty, hard-working, suffering to the unspeakable, but despite all these virtues, the husband betrays them, abandons them and many times even against their own will, it is their karma unfortunately.

Some women of CAPRICORN get involved with other men, but this is only when they have already been abandoned by the husband and after having suffered frightfully.

The men and women of CAPRICORN are quite SELFISH, even if not all; we refer to the inferior type of CAPRICORN. Due to this, to that SELFISHNESS, they make many commitments and also they fill themselves with enemies.

The natives of CAPRICORN cling a lot to things, to money and some even become very stingy.

CAPRICORN is an earth sign, fixed, stable. However, the natives of CAPRICORN make many trips even if they are short.

The moral pains of the CAPRICORNIANS are terrible, they suffer too much, fortunately their practical sense of life saves them and they soon overcome the worst bitterness of life.
