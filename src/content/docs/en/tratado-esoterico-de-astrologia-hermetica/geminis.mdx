22nd MAY TO 21st JUNE

IDENTIFICATION and FASCINATION lead to the DREAM of CONSCIOUSNESS. Example: You are walking calmly down the street; you suddenly come across a public demonstration; the multitudes are shouting, the leaders of the people are speaking, the flags are waving in the air, the people seem like madmen, everyone is talking, everyone is shouting.

That PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION is very interesting; you have already forgotten everything you had to do, you identify with the crowds, the words of the speakers convince you.

The PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION is so interesting that you have forgotten YOURSELVES, you have IDENTIFIED so much with that STREET DEMONSTRATION, that you no longer think of anything else, you are fascinated, now you fall into the dream of consciousness; mixed with the crowds that shout, you also shout and even throw stones and insults; you are dreaming beautifully, you don't even know who you are, you have forgotten everything.

Let's now give another simpler example: You are in the living room of your house sitting in front of the television screen, scenes of cowboys appear, there are shootouts, dramas of lovers, etc., etc.

The film is very interesting, it has totally captured your attention, you have forgotten yourselves so much that you even shout enthusiastically, you are IDENTIFIED with the cowboys, with the gunshots, with the couple in love.

The Fascination is now terrible, you don't even remotely remember yourselves, you have entered a very deep sleep, at those moments you only want to see the triumph of the hero of the film, at those moments you only want the luck that he can run.

There are thousands and millions of circumstances that produce IDENTIFICATION, FASCINATION, DREAM. People IDENTIFY with PEOPLE, IDEAS and every kind of IDENTIFICATION is followed by FASCINATION and DREAM.

People live with DORMANT CONSCIOUSNESS, they work dreaming, they drive cars dreaming and they also kill pedestrians who are dreaming through the streets, absorbed in their own thoughts.

During the hours of rest of the physical body, the EGO(I) leaves the PHYSICAL BODY and takes its dreams wherever it goes. When returning to the physical body, when entering again the state of Wakefulness, it continues with its same dreams and thus spends all its life dreaming.

The people who die cease to exist, but the EGO, the I, continues in the SUPRASENSIBLE regions beyond death. At the hour of death the EGO takes its dreams, its worldliness and lives in the world of the dead with its dreams, continues dreaming, with the CONSCIOUSNESS asleep, wanders like a sleepwalker, asleep, unconscious.

Whoever wants to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS must work it here and now. We have the CONSCIOUSNESS INCARNATED and therefore we must WORK it here and now. Whoever AWAKENS CONSCIOUSNESS here in this world awakens in all the Worlds.

Whoever AWAKENS CONSCIOUSNESS in this THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD, AWAKENS in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh DIMENSIONS.

Whoever wants to live CONSCIOUS in the HIGHER WORLDS, must AWAKEN here and now.

The four gospels insist on the need to AWAKEN, but people do not understand.

People sleep deeply, but they believe they are awake, when someone accepts that they are asleep, it is a clear sign that they are already beginning to awaken.

It is very difficult to make other people understand that they have a DORMANT CONSCIOUSNESS, people never accept the tremendous truth that they are asleep.

Whoever wants to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS must practice from MOMENT to MOMENT the INTIMATE REMEMBRANCE of Oneself.

This of being REMEMBERING oneself from MOMENT to MOMENT, is in fact an intensive work.

Just a moment, an instant of forgetfulness is enough to begin to dream beautifully.

We URGENTLY need to be watching all our thoughts, feelings, desires, emotions, habits, instincts, sexual impulses, etc.

Every thought, every emotion, every movement, every instinctive act, every sexual impulse, must be immediately self-observed as they arise in our PSYCHE; any carelessness in attention, is enough to fall into the dream of CONSCIOUSNESS.

Many times you go down the street absorbed in your own thoughts, identified with those thoughts, fascinated, dreaming beautifully; suddenly a friend passes by you, greets you, you do not answer the greeting because you do not see him, you are dreaming; the friend gets angry, assumes that you are people without education or that you are possibly angry, the friend is also dreaming, if he were awake he would not make such conjectures, he would immediately realise that you are asleep.

There are many times when you mistake the door and knock where you shouldn't knock, because you are asleep.

You are in a city transport vehicle, you have to get off at a certain street, but you are identified, fascinated, dreaming beautifully with a business in your mind, or with a memory, or with an affection, suddenly you have realised that you have passed the street, you stop the vehicle and then go back a few streets on foot.

It is very difficult to stay awake from moment to moment but it is INDISPENSABLE.

When we learn to live awake from moment to moment, then we stop dreaming here and outside the physical body.

It is necessary to know that people when they fall asleep leave their bodies, but they take their dreams, they live in the internal worlds dreaming and when they return to the physical body, they continue with their dreams, they continue dreaming.

When one learns to live AWAKE from moment to moment, one stops dreaming here and in the internal worlds.

It is necessary to know that the EGO (I) wrapped in its LUNAR BODIES, LEAVES the PHYSICAL BODY when the body falls asleep, unfortunately the EGO lives asleep in the INTERNAL WORLDS.

Inside the LUNAR BODIES there exists besides the EGO, what is called ESSENCE, SOUL, FRACTION OF SOUL, BUDHATA, CONSCIOUSNESS. It is that CONSCIOUSNESS that we must AWAKEN here and now.

Here in this world we have the CONSCIOUSNESS, here we must AWAKEN it, if we really want to stop dreaming and live conscious in the higher worlds.

The PERSON with awakened consciousness while their body rests in their bed, lives, works, acts conscious in the HIGHER WORLDS.

The CONSCIOUS person has no problems of OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE, the problem of learning to have OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCES at will is only for the ASLEEP.

The AWAKE person does not even worry about learning to have OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCES, lives conscious in the HIGHER WORLDS, while their physical body sleeps in the bed.

The AWAKE person no longer DREAMS, during the rest of the body lives in those regions where people are dreaming, but with the CONSCIOUSNESS AWAKE.

The AWAKE PERSON is in contact with the WHITE LODGE, visits the TEMPLES of the GREAT UNIVERSAL WHITE FRATERNITY, meets with their GURU-DEVA, while their body sleeps.

The INTIMATE REMEMBRANCE OF ONESELF from moment to moment, develops the SPATIAL sense and then we can even see the dreams of the people who walk through the streets.

The SPATIAL SENSE includes in ITSELF, sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, etc. The SPATIAL SENSE is the FUNCTIONALISM of the AWAKENED CONSCIOUSNESS.

The CHAKRAS, of which occultist literature speaks, in relation to the spatial sense, are what the flame of a match is to the Sun.

While the INTIMATE REMEMBRANCE of oneself from moment to moment, is fundamental to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS, it is no less so to learn to manage ATTENTION.

GNOSTIC students must learn to divide ATTENTION into three parts: SUBJECT, OBJECT, PLACE.

SUBJECT. Not to fall into the forgetfulness of ONESELF before any representation.

OBJECT. Observe in detail every thing, every representation, every fact, every event no matter how insignificant it may seem, without the SELF-FORGETFULNESS of ONESELF.

PLACE. Rigorous observation of the place where we are, asking OURSELVES: What place is this? Why am I here?

Within this PLACE factor, we must include the DIMENSIONAL question, as it could be the case that we are actually in the fourth or fifth DIMENSION of nature during the moment of OBSERVATION; let us remember that nature has seven DIMENSIONS.

Within the THREE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD reigns the law of gravity. Within the HIGHER DIMENSIONS of nature, there exists the Law of LEVITATION.

When observing a place, we must never forget the question of the seven DIMENSIONS of nature; it is then convenient to ask OURSELVES: In which DIMENSION am I?, and then it is necessary, as a means of verification, to take a little jump as long as possible with the intention of floating in the surrounding environment. It is logical that if we float it is because we are outside the PHYSICAL BODY. We must never forget that when the physical body sleeps, the EGO with the LUNAR BODIES and the ESSENCE inside, wanders unconscious like a sleepwalker in the MOLECULAR WORLD.

The DIVISION OF ATTENTION between SUBJECT, OBJECT, PLACE, leads to the AWAKENING of CONSCIOUSNESS.

Many GNOSTIC students after getting used to this exercise, to this DIVISION OF ATTENTION in three parts, to these questions, to this little jump, etc., during the state of wakefulness, from moment to moment, ended up practising the same exercise during the sleep of the physical body, when they were really in the higher worlds and when giving the famous experimental jump, they floated deliciously in the surrounding environment; then they awakened CONSCIOUSNESS, then they remembered that the physical body had remained asleep in the bed and full of joy they could dedicate themselves to the study of the MYSTERIES of life and DEATH, in the HIGHER DIMENSIONS.

It is only LOGICAL to say that an exercise that is practised from moment to moment daily, that becomes a habit, a custom, is so engraved in the different areas of the MIND, that it is then automatically repeated during sleep, when we are really outside the physical body and the result is the AWAKENING of CONSCIOUSNESS.

GEMINI is an air sign, governed by the PLANET MERCURY. GEMINI governs the lungs, arms and legs.

PRACTICE. During the ZODIACAL SIGN OF GEMINI, Gnostic students should lie on their backs and relax the body. Then you have to inhale the air five times and exhale it another five; when inhaling you have to imagine that the light previously accumulated in the larynx, now acts in the bronchi and lungs. When inhaling, legs and arms will open to the right and left, when exhaling, legs and arms will close.

The metal of GEMINI is MERCURY, the stone is GOLD BERYL, the colour is YELLOW.

The natives of GEMINI love to travel, they make the mistake of despising the wise voice of the heart, they want to solve everything with the mind, they get angry easily, they are very dynamic, versatile, fickle, irritable, intelligent, their lives are full of successes and failures, they possess a crazy value.

The natives of Gemini are problematic because of their rare DUALISM, because of that DOUBLE PERSONALITY that characterises them and that is symbolised among the Greeks by those MYSTERIOUS BROTHERS called CASTOR and POLLUX.

The native of GEMINI never knows how they are going to proceed in such or such a case, precisely because of their DOUBLE PERSONALITY.

At any given moment the native of GEMINI turns out to be a very sincere friend, capable of sacrificing even their own life for friendship, for the person to whom they have offered their affection, but at any other moment, they are capable of the worst infamies against that same beloved person.

The inferior type of GEMINI is very dangerous and therefore their friendship is not advisable.

The most serious defect of the natives of GEMINI, is the tendency to falsely judge all people.

The twins CASTOR and POLLUX invite us to reflection. It is known, in fact, that in nature manifested matter and hidden energy symbolised in heat, light, electricity, chemical forces and other superior ones that are still unknown to us, are always processed in reverse and the appearance of one always presupposes the ENTROPY or DISAPPEARANCE of the other, neither more nor less than the MYSTERIOUS BROTHERS CASTOR and POLLUX, symbol of such phenomenon among the Greeks. They lived and died alternately as matter and energy are born and die alternately, appear and disappear, wherever matter and energy are.

The process of GEMINI is vital in COSMOGENESIS. The original Earth was a sun that gradually condensed at the expense of a nebulous ring, to the lamentable state of darkened silver, when the first solid film of our globe was determined by irradiation or cooling through the chemical phenomenon of dissipation or ENTROPY of the energy that constitutes the gross states of matter that we call solids and liquids.

All these changes in nature are carried out in accordance with the intimate processes of CASTOR and POLLUX.

By these times of the TWENTIETH Century, life has already begun its return to the ABSOLUTE and gross matter begins to transform into ENERGY. We have been told that in the FIFTH ROUND the EARTH will be a corpse, a new MOON and that life will develop with all its constructive and destructive processes, within the etheric world.

From the ESOTERIC point of view we can assure that CASTOR and POLLUX are the twin souls.

The BEING, the INTIMATE of each of us, has two TWIN SOULS, the SPIRITUAL, and the HUMAN.

In the common and ordinary INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL, the BEING, the INTIMATE, is neither BORN nor dies, nor is REINCARNATED, but it does send the ESSENCE to each new PERSONALITY; this is a FRACTION of the HUMAN SOUL; the BUDHATA.

It is urgent to know that the BUDHATA, the ESSENCE, is deposited inside the LUNAR BODIES with which the EGO is clothed.

Speaking a little more clearly, we will say that the ESSENCE is unfortunately bottled among the LUNAR EGO. The lost descend.

The descent to the HELL-WORLDS, only aims to destroy the LUNAR BODIES and THE EGO, through the SUBMERGED INVOLUTION. Only by destroying the bottle, the ESSENCE escapes.

All those incessant changes of MATTER into ENERGY and energy into matter, always invites us to reflect on GEMINI.

Gemini is intimately related to the bronchi, lungs and breathing. The MICROCOSM-MAN is made in the image and likeness of the MACRO-COSMOS.

THE EARTH also breathes. The earth inhales the vital SULPHUR of the SUN and then exhales it already converted into terrestrial SULPHUR; this is, analogous to the man who inhales pure oxygen and exhales it converted into carbon dioxide.

This vital wave, alternately ascending and descending, a true systole and diastole, inspiration and expiration arises from the deepest bosom of the earth.
