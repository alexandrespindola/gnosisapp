20 JANUARY TO 19 FEBRUARY

The hidden meaning of AQUARIUS is KNOWLEDGE. AQUARIUS, the sign of the water bearer, is an eminently REVOLUTIONARY zodiac sign.

There are four kinds of KNOWLEDGE or SECRET SCIENCE. We need to know what these four kinds of KNOWLEDGE are.

FIRST: VAJNA-VIDYA; knowledge acquired with certain hidden powers awakened within our own inner nature, through certain Magical Rituals.

SECOND: KABALISTIC MAHA-VIDYA. The SCIENCE of the KABBALAH with all its invocations, mathematics, symbols and liturgy, can be ANGELIC or DIABOLICAL, it all depends on the type of person who uses it.

THIRD: GUPTA-VIDYA; science of MANTRAS, Magic of the WORD; it is based on the mystical powers of sound, on the science of HARMONY.

FOURTH: ATMA-VIDYA or REAL WISDOM of the BEING, of the ATMAN, of the SUPERIOR MONAD.

All these forms of KNOWLEDGE, except the FOURTH, are the root of all the occult sciences. From all those forms of knowledge, except the FOURTH, come the KABBALAH, CHIROMANCY, ASTROLOGY, OCCULT PHYSIOLOGY, SCIENTIFIC CARTOMANCY, etc., etc.

Of all those forms of knowledge, of all these OCCULTIST BRANCHES, science has already discovered some secrets, but DEVELOPED SPATIAL SENSE IS NOT HYPNOTISM nor can it be acquired by these arts.

THE PRESENT HERMETIC ESOTERIC ASTROLOGICAL BOOK has nothing to do with the fairground ASTROLOGY mentioned in NEWSPAPERS. In this book we teach ATMA-VIDYA SCIENCE.

The fundamental thing is ATMA-VIDYA, it includes all of them in their ESSENTIAL aspect and can even use them occasionally; but it only uses its synthetic extracts, purified of all dross.

The GOLDEN GATE of Wisdom can be transformed into the wide gate and broad path that leads to destruction, the gate of magical arts practiced for selfish purposes.

We are in the AGE of KALI-YUGA, the IRON age, the BLACK AGE and all students of OCCULTISM are predisposed to stray along the black path. It is astonishing to see the mistaken concept that the "little brothers" have about OCCULTISM and the ease with which they believe they can reach the DOOR and cross the THRESHOLD of MYSTERY without a GREAT SACRIFICE.

It is impossible to achieve ATMA-VIDYA without the THREE FACTORS of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

ATMA-VIDYA is impossible without having reached the SECOND BIRTH. ATMA-VIDYA is impossible without the death of the PLURALIZED I. ATMA-VIDYA is impossible without SACRIFICE for humanity.

It is NOT the Law of EVOLUTION that confers ATMA-VIDYA upon us. It is not the Law of INVOLUTION that confers ATMA-VIDYA upon us. Only on the basis of TREMENDOUS and FRIGHTFUL INTIMATE REVOLUTIONS, do we reach ATMA-VIDYA.

The PATH of the REVOLUTION of consciousness is the PATH OF THE RAZOR'S EDGE; this path is TERRIBLY DIFFICULT; this path is full of dangers inside and out.

We are now going to study in this chapter each of the THREE FACTORS of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS in an orderly and separate way, so that Gnostic students can orient themselves correctly.

Our readers should pay close attention to the study of each of the THREE FACTORS of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, because the SUCCESS in this WORK depends on the full UNDERSTANDING of each of these THREE FACTORS.

### BORN

The SECOND BIRTH is a totally sexual problem. The Sacred APIS BULL among the ancient EGYPTIANS, had to be young, healthy and strong to symbolize the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. (SEX.)

The Greeks instructed by the Egyptian Hierophants also represented the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE in this way, with one or several BULLS, as can also be seen in the fable of the CRETAN MINOTAUR.

The BULLS that HERCULES stole from Geryon had the same Alchemical meaning; we find the same symbolism in the legend of the SACRED OXEN of the SUN that grazed peacefully on the ISLAND of SICILY and were stolen by Mercury.

Not all sacred BULLS were black or white; some were RED like those of Geryon and like those sacrificed by the Israelite Priest, because the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, at a certain Alchemical moment is RED and every Alchemist knows this.

The famous APIS ox, so adored in the EGYPTIAN MYSTERIES, was the creator and the prosecutor of SOULS. The SYMBOLIC APIS ox was consecrated to ISIS, because in fact it is related to the SACRED COW, the DIVINE MOTHER, ISIS, whose veil no mortal has lifted.

In order for an ox to have the high honour of being promoted to such a category, it had to be black and have a white spot on its forehead or on one of its shoulders in the shape of a Lunar crescent.

It is also certain and completely true, that said sacred ox must have been conceived under the impression of lightning and have under its tongue the mark of the sacred scarab.

APIS was the SYMBOL of the MOON, both because of its horns in the shape of a Lunar crescent, and because during, except for the Full Moon, this celestial body always has a dark part indicated by the black of the skin and another resplendent part, symbolized by the white spot.

APIS is the PHILOSOPHICAL MATTER, the ENS SEMINIS (SEMEN), that semi-solid, semi-liquid substance, that VITRIOL of the ALCHEMISTS.

Within the ENS SEMINIS is found all the ENS VIRTUTIS of FIRE. It is necessary to transform the MOON into SUN, that is, to manufacture the SOLAR BODIES.

These are the MYSTERIES OF ISIS, the MYSTERIES of the APIS BULL. When the RUNE IS was studied in the old Egypt of the PHARAOHS, its two aspects were analyzed. MASCULINE-FEMININE, because the SACRED WORD ISIS is broken down into two syllables IS-IS; the first SYLLABLE is MASCULINE and the second is FEMININE.

The APIS BULL is the BULL of ISIS, the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. Man and woman must work in their LABORATORIUM ORATORIUM with that PHILOSOPHICAL MATTER, to transform the MOON into SUN.

It is URGENT to acquire that MAGIC power called KRIYA-SHAKTI or of the WILL and of YOGA, the Magic power of the SOLAR MEN, the supreme power of CREATION, without Generation and this is only possible with MAITHUNA. (See chapter eight.)

It is necessary to learn to intelligently combine the waters of life between the two AMPHORAS of AQUARIUS, the zodiac sign of the WATER BEARER.

It is indispensable to combine the RED ELIXIR with the WHITE ELIXIR, if you want to reach the SECOND BIRTH.

The MOON symbolizes ISIS, the DIVINE MOTHER, the ineffable PRAKRITI and the APIS BULL represents THE PHILOSOPHICAL MATTER, the SACRED STONE of the ALCHEMIST.

In the Apis Bull is represented the MOON, ISIS, the PRIMORDIAL SUBSTANCE, THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, the MAITHUNA.

AQUARIUS is governed by URANUS and this planet controls the SEXUAL GLANDS. It is impossible to reach the SECOND BIRTH, the ADEPT, the INTIMATE SELF-REALIZATION, if we do not study the MYSTERIES of ISIS, if we despise the cult of the APIS BULL, if we do not learn to combine the RED ELIXIR with the WHITE ELIXIR between the two AMPHORAS of AQUARIUS.

In Christian terminology there is talk of FOUR human BODIES. The first is the CARNAL BODY; the second is the NATURAL BODY; the third is the SPIRITUAL BODY; the fourth, according to the terminology of the Esoteric Christian type, is the DIVINE BODY.

Speaking in Theosophical language, we will say that the first is the PHYSICAL BODY, the second is the ASTRAL BODY; the third is the MENTAL BODY; the fourth is the CAUSAL BODY or BODY OF THE CONSCIOUS WILL.

Our critics will be annoyed because we do not mention the LINGAM SARIRA or VITAL BODY, also called ETHEREAL DOUBLE. Certainly we do not count such BODY, due to the concrete fact that this is only the upper section of the PHYSICAL BODY, the fundamental basic seat of all the physical, chemical, caloric, reproductive, perceptive activities, etc.

The common and current INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is NOT BORN with the ASTRAL, nor with the MENTAL, much less with the CAUSAL BODY; these bodies can only be cultivated artificially in the IGNITED FORGE OF VULCAN. (SEX.)

THE ASTRAL BODY is not an indispensable IMPLEMENT for the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL; it is a luxury, a great luxury that very few can afford; however, the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL has a MOLECULAR BODY, a BODY OF DESIRES similar to the ASTRAL BODY, but of a LUNAR, cold, ghostly, spectral type.

The INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL does not have a MENTAL BODY, but it possesses an animal intellectual vehicle, subtle, LUNAR, very similar to the MENTAL BODY, but of a cold and ghostly nature.

The INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL does not have a CAUSAL BODY or BODY OF conscious WILL, but it has the ESSENCE, the BUDHATA, the EMBRYO OF SOUL that is easily confused with the CAUSAL BODY.

The subtle BODIES that LEADBEATER, ANNIE BESANT, STEINER and many other clairvoyants studied in the poor common and current INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL, are the LUNAR vehicles.

Whoever wants to reach the SECOND BIRTH must manufacture the SOLAR BODIES, the authentic ASTRAL BODY, the legitimate MENTAL BODY, the true CAUSAL BODY or BODY OF CONSCIOUS WILL.

There is something that may surprise GNOSTIC students: the ASTRAL, MENTAL and CAUSAL BODIES are flesh and blood, and after having been born from the immaculate womb of the DIVINE MOTHER, they need food for their growth and development.

There are two types of meat: the first is meat that comes from ADAM; the second is meat that does NOT come from ADAM. The SOLAR BODIES are flesh that does not come from ADAM.

It is interesting to know that the SEXUAL HYDROGEN SI-12, always crystallizes into flesh and blood. The physical body is flesh and blood, and the SOLAR bodies are also flesh and blood.

The basic food of the PHYSICAL BODY is HYDROGEN FORTY-EIGHT.

The fundamental food of the ASTRAL BODY is HYDROGEN TWENTY-FOUR.

The indispensable food of the MENTAL BODY is HYDROGEN TWELVE.

The vital food of the CAUSAL BODY is HYDROGEN SIX.

All the MASTERS of the WHITE LODGE, ANGELS, ARCHANGELS, THRONES, SERAPHIM, VIRTUES, etc., etc., etc., are dressed in SOLAR BODIES.

Only those who have SOLAR BODIES have the BEING INCARNATED. Only he who possesses the BEING is a Man of TRUTH.

The PHYSICAL BODY is controlled by forty-eight laws, the ASTRAL BODY is governed by twenty-four laws, the MENTAL BODY is dominated by twelve laws; the CAUSAL BODY depends on six Laws.

It is URGENT to go down to the IGNITED FORGE of VULCAN (SEX), to work with fire and water, origin of worlds, beasts, men and GODS; it is urgent to descend to the ninth sphere to manufacture the SOLAR BODIES and achieve the SECOND BIRTH.

It causes pain to know that many who presume to be MASTERS and SAINTS, are still dressed in LUNAR BODIES.

### DEATH

COUNT GABALIS is completely wrong when he says that SALAMANDERS, GNOMES, SYLPHS, NYMPHS, need to marry a man to become immortal.

COUNT GABALIS' assertion that we need to completely renounce women in order to dedicate ourselves to the immortalization of SYLPHIDES AND NYMPHS is stupid.

The ELEMENTALS of the ELEMENTS, of the plants, of the minerals, animals, will be the men of the future without the need of the unclean coitus recommended by COUNT GABALIS.

It is a pity that many MEDIUMS of spiritism are married to ELEMENTALS and that many people during sleep cohabit with INCUBI, SUCCUBI and ELEMENTALS of all kinds.

The INTERNAL WORLDS are full of all kinds of creatures, some good, others bad, others indifferent.

The DEVAS or ANGELS, are never inferior to MAN. The DEVAS or ANGELS are TRUE SOLAR MEN and that is all. The DEVAS or ANGELS are TWICE BORN.

For the Chinese, the two highest classes of invisible inhabitants are the THIEN of a totally celestial nature and the THI, THU or intermediaries.

In the gorges of KUEN-LUN, the central region of the earth or LUNAR MOUNTAINS, tradition has placed a whole strange and mysterious world governed by GODS.

Those DIVINE BEINGS are the KO-HAN or LOHANES GOVERNING GODS of millions of creatures.

The THI wear yellow robes and inhabit crypts or underground caverns; they feed on sesame, coriander and other flowers and fruits of the tree of life; they are TWICE BORN, they study ALCHEMY, OCCULT BOTANY, the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE in the manner of MASTER ZANONI and his WISE COMPANION, the GREAT MEJNOUR.

A third class of invisible inhabitants are the fabulous SHEN or SHAIN, born here below in the SUBLUNAR world, either to work for the good, or to pay their ancestral KARMA vice.

The fourth class of inhabitants of the internal worlds cited by the CHINESE, are the DARK MAHA-SHAN, giant sorcerers of BLACK MAGIC.

The rarest and most incomprehensible beings are the terrible MARUT or TURAM; beings mentioned by the RIG VEDA, legions of HANASMUSSIANS; this word is pronounced with j, like this: JANASMUSSIANS.

These legions consist of three hundred and forty-three families, even though certain calculations raise the amount to 823 or 543 families.

It is lamentable that these HANASMUSSEN are worshipped by certain Muslims and BRAHMANES.

The HANASMUSSIANS have, as we already said in chapter nine of this book, two personalities; one ANGELIC and the other DIABOLICAL.

It is clear that the SOLAR, ANGELIC PERSONALITY of a HANASMUSSIAN, will never agree to instruct any candidate for INITIATION, without first telling him with complete FRANKNESS: "BEWARE, WE ARE THE TEMPTATION THAT CAN BECOME AN UNBELIEVER".

The SOLAR PERSONALITY of every MARUT or TURAM, HANASMUSSIAN, knows very well that it possesses another LUNAR, DIABOLICAL, DARK PERSONALITY, capable of diverting the candidate to INITIATION.

Before all twice BORN, two paths open, the one on the right and the one on the left. The one on the right is that of those who resolve to DIE FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT, that of those who DISSOLVE THE I. The one on the LEFT is the black path, the path of those who instead of DYING FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT, instead of DISSOLVING THE I, FORTIFY it among the LUNAR BODIES. Those who go along the path of the left hand, become MARUT or TURAM, that is to say, HANASMUSSIANS.

Those who want to reach FINAL LIBERATION, must DIE from MOMENT to MOMENT. Only DYING THE SELF do we become PERFECT ANGELS.

There are three kinds of TANTRISM, WHITE, BLACK AND GREY. MAITHUNA with ejaculation of the ENS SEMINIS, is BLACK. MAITHUNA sometimes with ejaculation of the ENS SEMINIS and sometimes without ejaculation, is GREY.

With MAITHUNA without ejaculation DEVI KUNDALINI rises through the medullary canal to develop Divine powers and convert us into ANGELS.

With MAITHUNA with EJACULATION the IGNEOUS SERPENT OF OUR MAGICAL POWERS, instead of rising, descends, it plunges from the COXÍGEO bone, towards the atomic hells of man, becoming the TAIL OF SATAN.

MAITHUNA with ejaculation sometimes and without ejaculation sometimes, is something incoherent, morbid, bestial, that only serves to strengthen the LUNAR EGO.

The BLACK TANTRICS develop the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUATOR ORGAN. It is necessary to know that said FATAL ORGAN is the same TAIL OF SATAN.

In times that are lost in the deep night of all ages, the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL understood its sad situation as a necessary machine for the economy of nature and wished to die; it was then necessary the intervention of certain SACRED INDIVIDUALS who committed the error of giving to this sad human anthill, the abominable KUNDARTIGUATOR ORGAN.

When the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL forgot its sad situation as a MACHINE and fell in love with the beauties of this world, the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUATOR ORGAN was eliminated; unfortunately the bad consequences of said organ was something that could not be forgotten, they remained deposited in the five cylinders of the machine.

The first cylinder is that of the INTELLECT and is found in the BRAIN; the second is that of the EMOTIONS and resides in the SOLAR PLEXUS, at the height of the navel; the third is that of the MOVEMENT and is located in the UPPER PART OF THE SPINE; the fourth is that of the INSTINCT, and is found in the LOWER PART OF THE SPINE; the fifth is that of SEX and resides in the SEXUAL organs.

The bad consequences of the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUATOR ORGAN are represented by thousands and millions of small YOES of an animal and perverse type.

In the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL there does not exist a single center of command, nor a permanent YO or EGO.

Each IDEA, each feeling, each sensation, each desire, each YO DESIRE such a thing, YO DESIRE SUCH ANOTHER THING, YO LOVE, YO DO NOT LOVE, is a different YO.

All these small and quarrelsome YOES quarrel among themselves, they fight for supremacy, they are not linked among themselves, nor coordinated in any way. Each of these small YOES depends on the changes of circumstances of life and on the changes of impressions.

Each small YO has its own ideas, its own criterion, there is no true INDIVIDUALITY in the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL, its concept, its acts, its ideas, depend on the YO that at that moment dominates the situation.

When a YO becomes enthusiastic about GNOSIS, he swears eternal loyalty to our GNOSTIC MOVEMENT; this enthusiasm lasts until another YO who is contrary to these studies, takes over the power, then we see with astonishment that the subject retires and even becomes our enemy.

The YO that today swears ETERNAL LOVE to a woman, is later displaced by another YO that has nothing to do with such a vow and then the woman suffers the disappointment.

Such YO automatically follows such another one and some always appear accompanied by others, but there is no order or system among all those YOES.

Each one of those YOES believes in a given moment to be the whole, but it is really no more than an intimate part of our functions, even when he has the impression of being the totality, the reality, the complete man.

The curious thing is that we give credit to the YO of a moment, even when moments later that YO is displaced by another YO. THE LUNAR EGO is a sum of YOES that must be eliminated in a radical way.

It is necessary to know that each one of the five cylinders of the machine possesses its own characteristics that we must never confuse.

Among the five centers of the machine there are differences of speed.

People praise the thought a lot, but in reality the INTELLECTUAL CENTER is the slowest. Afterwards, even when much faster, come the INSTINCTIVE and MOVEMENT or MOTOR CENTERS, which have more or less the same speed. The fastest of all is the SEXUAL CENTER, and it is followed in order of rapidity, by the EMOTIONAL CENTER.

There is enormous difference of speeds between each one of the five CENTERS of the machine.

Studying in ourselves auto-observing ourselves, we will see at simple sight that the MOVEMENT is more rapid than the thought and that the emotion is more rapid than any movement and that every thought.

The MOTOR and INSTINCTIVE centers are THIRTY THOUSAND times faster than the INTELLECTUAL CENTER. The EMOTIONAL CENTER when it works at the speed that is proper to it, is THIRTY THOUSAND times faster than the MOTOR and INSTINCTIVE centers.

The diverse CENTERS have each one their completely distinct TIME. The speed of the centers explains a great number of well known phenomena that ordinary common and current science cannot explain; it is enough to remember the astonishing speed of certain psychological, physiological and mental processes.

Every CENTER is divided in two parts: positive and negative; this division is particularly clear for the INTELLECTUAL CENTER and for the INSTINCTIVE CENTER.

All the work of the INTELLECTUAL CENTER is divided in two parts: AFFIRMATION and NEGATION; YES and NO, THESIS and ANTITHESIS.

In the INSTINCTIVE CENTER there exists the same fight between the pleasant and the unpleasant; pleasant sensations, unpleasant sensations and all those sensations are related with the five senses: to see, to hear, to smell, to taste, to touch.

In the MOTOR or MOVEMENT CENTER, there exists a fight between the MOVEMENT and the REST.

In the EMOTIONAL CENTER there exist pleasant and unpleasant emotions: joy, sympathy, affection, confidence in oneself, etc., are positive.

The unpleasant EMOTIONS, such as boredom, jealousy, envy, anger, irritability, fear, are totally negative.

In the SEXUAL CENTER there exists the attraction and the repulsion, the chastity and the lust in eternal conflict.

The INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL sacrifices its pleasures if it is necessary, but it turns out to be incapable of sacrificing its own sufferings.

Whoever wants to DISSOLVE THE PLURALIZED I, must sacrifice its own sufferings. The JEALOUSY produces sufferings, if we annihilate the jealousy, the suffering dies, the pain is sacrificed.

The IRA produces PAIN; if we finish with the IRA we sacrifice the PAIN, we destroy it.

It is necessary to AUTO-OBSERVE ourselves from moment to moment; the PLURALIZED YO works in each one of the FIVE CENTERS OF THE MACHINE. Sometimes it is a YO of the EMOTIONAL CENTER who reacts coleric or jealous or envious, other times the prejudices and calumnies of the intellectual center with all its fury, attack violently, others the perverse mistaken habits take us to the failure, etc., etc., etc.

Each CENTER has FORTY AND NINE SUBCONSCIOUS regions and in each one of those regions live millions of YOES that we need to DISCOVER through the MEDITATION of bottom.

When we AUTO-DISCOVER ourselves, when we become CONSCIOUS of the activities of the YO in the five centers of the machine and in the forty and nine subconscious regions, then we AWAKEN CONSCIENCE.

To become conscious of all the PROCESS of the YO in the five cylinders of the machine, is to make CONSCIOUS the SUBCONSCIOUS.

It turns out to be impossible to eliminate the different YOES if before we have not UNDERSTOOD them CONSCIOUSLY in the forty and nine SUBCONSCIOUS regions.

We can work with PROSERPINE the QUEEN of the HELLS eliminating YOES, to condition of understanding first the defect that we want to eradicate. (See Chapter Eight).

PROSERPINE only eliminates the YOES that personify the defects that we have understood in an INTEGRAL way.

It is impossible to arrive to the ATMA-VIDYA without before having KNOWN ourselves.

NOSCE TE IPSUM; man KNOW yourself and you will know the universe and the GODS.

To know the activity of the five cylinders of the machine in all the forty and nine corridors or SUBCONSCIOUS regions of JALDABAOTH, means to KNOW oneself, to make CONSCIOUS the SUBCONSCIOUS, to AUTO-DISCOVER ourselves.

Whoever wants to go up must first go down. Whoever wants the ATMA-VIDYA must first go down to its own atomic hells, the error of many students of OCCULTISM is to want first to GO UP without before having gone down.

In coexistence with the people spontaneously our defects arise, and if we are ALERT, we discover of which CENTER they proceed, then by means of the MEDITATION we will discover them in each and every one of the forty and nine SUBCONSCIOUS regions.

ONLY DYING THE YO in total form, we reach the ATMA-VIDYA, THE ABSOLUTE ILLUMINATION.

### SACRIFICE

The SACRIFICE SATTVICO is done according to the DIVINE COMMANDMENTS, concentrating on the cult, only for the cult, by men that do not desire the result.

The SACRIFICE RAYASICO is done by temptation and desiring the fruits.

The SACRIFICE TAMASICO is done always against the commandments, without FAITH, without the MANTRAS, without charity for nobody, without LOVE to the humanity, without offering the sacred obolus to the PRIESTS or Gurus, etc., etc., etc.

The third factor of the REVOLUTION of the CONSCIENCE is the SACRIFICE, but the SACRIFICE SATTVICO, without desiring the fruit of the action, without desiring reward; disinterested sacrifice, pure, sincere, giving its life so that others live and without asking anything in reward.

The reader must return to study the lesson of VIRGO, chapter six, so that it understands well what the three GUNAS of the PRAKRITI are, called SATTVA, RAJAS and TAMAS.

The LAW of the SOLAR LOGOS is sacrifice. He crucifies himself in the dawn of the life in every new world that arises of the CHAOS, so that all the beings have LIFE and have it in abundance.

All that one that has arrived to the SECOND BIRTH, must SACRIFICE himself by the humanity, to raise the torch well highly to teach to others the way that leads to the LIGHT.

That one that SACRIFICES himself by the humanity, reaches the VENUSTA INITIATION. It is urgent to know that the VENUSTA INITIATION is the INCARNATION of the CHRIST in the man.

That one that INCARNATES THE CHRIST in Itself, has to live all the COSMIC DRAMA.

THE VENUSTA INITIATION has SEVEN degrees, it begins with the event of BELÉN and it finishes with the DEATH and the RESURRECTION of the LORD.

That one that reaches the VENUSTA INITIATION becomes a CHRIST also. Only with the three factors of the REVOLUTION of the conscience one arrives to the VENUSTA INITIATION.

PRACTICE: The sign of AQUARIUS governs the calves. The Brazilians call to the calves "VENTRE DAS PERNAS", "BELLY OF THE LEGS, and they are not mistaken, because seriously the calves are a wonderful magnetic belly.

The forces that go up of the earth after passing by the sieve of the feet, arrive to the calves in its ascending way and there they are with the forces that descend from above of the sky, of URANUS.

The forces that go up and those that go down, in its encounter they magnetize in intense form the calves; that's why these really are loaded with EROTISM.

Now we will explain ourselves why the INTELLECTUAL ANIMALS feel so attracted by the well formed calves of the women.

During the sign of AQUARIUS the disciples and disciples must do magnetic passes with its two hands on its calves from below towards above, with the purpose of magnetizing powerfully the calves, with the alive longing to be loaded with the extraordinary forces of the CONSTELLATION OF AQUARIUS.

These magnetic passes must be combined with the following PRAYER:

"FORCE PASSES, FORCE PASSES, FORCE PASSES, PENETRATE IN MY ORGANISM, GO UP TO JOIN WITH YOUR SISTER, THE CURRENT THAT COMES FROM ABOVE, OF THE SKY, OF URANUS".

URANUS and SATURN are the planets that govern to the constellation of AQUARIUS. URANUS is a totally REVOLUTIONARY planet.

Between the minerals of AQUARIUS the URANIUM stands out specially and the LEAD.

Stone of AQUARIUS, the SAPPHIRE, also the BLACK PEARL, certainly very difficult to find, more not impossible.

To the women of AQUARIUS we cannot advise them that they get married never with a TAURIN man, because they will be unfortunate all its life.

The natives of AQUARIUS have great disposition for the natural sciences, medicine, chemistry, botany, Astrology, Biology, Astronomy, etc., etc.

The natives of AQUARIUS are each one REVOLUTIONARY to its way, in its life, in its customs, in its house, outside of its house, etc., etc., etc.

The natives of AQUARIUS stand out as paladins, some in great, others in small, but all have a marked tendency to be paladins.

AQUARIUS is the sign of the GENIUS, where SATURN, the old one of the skies, contributes the depth that characterizes to him and URANUS the REVOLUTIONARY planet throws its rays on the human species.

The AQUARIANS of superior type are ALTRUISTS, PHILANTHROPIC, KIND, FAITHFUL IN THE FRIENDSHIP, SINCERE, they know to select its friendships, by instinct; by INTUITION they know the people and want always FRATERNITY, HUMANITY.

The AQUARIAN of inferior type is distrustful by nature, lover of the EXAGGERATED retreat, and its intelligence only is dedicated to the things of the physical world, to its problems, to its matters, to all what is sensible and material.

The AQUARIAN of superior type is precise in its things, concentrated, deep, perseverant, wonderful.

The women of AQUARIUS are good wives, good mothers, but they like to be outside of house and this bothers a lot to the husbands, especially if these are TAURINS.
