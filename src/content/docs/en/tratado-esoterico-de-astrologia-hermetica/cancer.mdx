22nd JUNE TO 23rd JULY

"Upon leaving the body, taking the path of fire, of daylight, of the bright fortnight of the Moon and of the northern solstice, those who know BRAHMA, go to BRAHMA." (Verse 24, Chapter 8-Bhagavad-Gita).

"The YOGI who, upon dying, goes by the path of smoke, of the dark fortnight of the Moon and of the southern solstice reaches the Lunar sphere, and then is reborn." (Verse 25, Chapter 8-Bhagavad-Gita).

"These two paths, the bright and the dark, are considered permanent. By the first, one is emancipated, and by the second, one is reborn." (Verse 26, Chapter 8-Bhagavad-Gita).

"The SELF is not born, nor does it die, nor is it reincarnated; it has no origin; it is eternal, immutable, the first of all, and does not die when the body is killed." (Verse 20, Chapter 8-Bhagavad-Gita).

The EGO is born, the EGO dies. Distinguish between the EGO and the SELF. The SELF is not BORN, nor does it die, nor is it REINCARNATED.

"The fruits of actions are of three kinds: unpleasant, pleasant, and the mixture of both. These fruits adhere, after death, to those who have not renounced them, but not to the man of enunciation." (Verse 12, Chapter XVIII-Bhagavad-Gita).

"Learn from ME, O you of mighty arms!, about these five causes, related to the fulfillment of actions, according to the highest Wisdom, which is the end of all action." (Verse 13, Chapter XVIII-Bhagavad-Gita).

"The body, the EGO, the organs, the functions, and the Deities (PLANETS) that preside over the organs, these are the five causes." (Verse 14, Chapter 18-Bhagavad-Gita).

"Any act, due or undue, be it physical, verbal or mental, has these five causes." (Verse 15, Chapter 18, Bhagavad-Gita).

"Being thus the case, he who, through defective understanding, considers the ATMAN (THE SELF), the ABSOLUTE, as the actor, that fool does not see REALITY." (Verse 16-Chapter 81-Bhagavad Gita).

The BHAGAVAD GITA makes, therefore, a difference between the EGO (I), and the SELF (the ATMAN).

The INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called MAN, is a composite of BODY, EGO (I), ORGANS and functions. A machine moved by the DEITIES or, better said, the PLANETS.

Many times, any cosmic catastrophe is enough for the waves that reach the earth to launch these sleeping human machines into the battlefields. Millions of sleeping machines, against millions of sleeping machines.

The MOON brings the EGOS to the womb and the Moon takes them away. Max Heindel says that CONCEPTION always takes place when the MOON is in CANCER. Without the Moon, conception is impossible.

The first seven years of life are governed by the MOON. The second seven years of life are MERCURIAL in one hundred percent, then the child goes to School, is restless, in incessant movement.

The third septennium of life, tender adolescence between fourteen and twenty-one years of life, is governed by Venus, the Star of love; that is the age of the pang, the age of love, the age in which we see life through rose-tinted glasses.

From 21 (TWENTY-ONE) to 42 (FORTY-TWO) years of life, we have to occupy our little place under the Sun and define our life. This time is governed by the Sun.

The SEPTENNIUM between forty-two and forty-nine years of age is MARTIAN in one hundred percent, and life then becomes a true battlefield, because MARS is war.

The period between forty-nine and fifty-six years of age is JUPITERIAN; those who have JUPITER well placed in their horoscope, it is clear that during this time of their life they are respected by everyone and if they do not possess the UNNECESSARY MUNDANE RICHES, they have at least what is necessary to be able to live very well.

Another is the fate of those who have JUPITER badly placed in their horoscope; these people then suffer unspeakably, lack bread, shelter, refuge, are mistreated by others, etc., etc., etc.

The period of life between fifty-six and sixty-three years is governed by the elder of the heavens, old Saturn.

Really, old age begins at fifty-six years. After the Saturn period, the MOON returns, she brings the EGO to BIRTH and she takes it away.

If we carefully observe the life of the elderly of very advanced age, we can verify that they certainly return to the age of children, some little old men and women go back to playing with toy cars and dolls. The elderly over sixty-three years of age and the children under seven years of age are governed by the MOON.

"Among thousands of men, perhaps one attempts to reach PERFECTION; among those who attempt, possibly one achieves perfection, and among the perfect, perhaps one knows ME perfectly." (Verse 3, Chapter VII-Bhagavad-Gita.)

The EGO is LUNAR and upon leaving the physical body it goes by the path of smoke, of the dark fortnight of the MOON and of the southern SOLSTICE and soon returns to a new womb. The MOON takes it and the MOON brings it, that is the LAW.

The EGO is dressed with LUNAR BODIES. The internal vehicles studied by THEOSOPHY are of LUNAR nature.

The sacred scriptures of the JAINAS say: "THE UNIVERSE IS POPULATED BY VARIOUS CREATURES EXISTING IN THE SAMSARA, BORN OF DISTINCT FAMILIES AND CASTES FOR HAVING COMMITTED VARIOUS ACTIONS AND ACCORDING TO THESE THEY GO SOMETIMES TO THE WORLD OF THE GODS, OTHER TIMES TO HELL AND SOMETIMES THEY BECOME ASURAS (DIABOLICAL PERSONS). SO THE LIVING BEINGS DO NOT REPUGN THE SAMSARA, WHO UNCEASINGLY ARE BORN AND REBORN FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR EVIL DEEDS".

The MOON takes all the EGOS, but does not bring all of them back. These days, most enter the HELL-WORLDS, in the SUBLUNAR regions, in the SUBMERGED MINERAL KINGDOM, in the outer darkness where only weeping and gnashing of teeth is heard.

There are many who return in a mediate or immediate way, brought and taken by the MOON, without having enjoyed the delights of the higher worlds.

The PERFECT, the chosen, those who DISSOLVED the EGO; FABRICATED their SOLAR BODIES and SACRIFICED themselves for HUMANITY, are BLESSED, upon leaving the physical body with death, they take the path of fire, of light, of day, of the bright fortnight of the MOON and of the northern solstice, they have INCARNATED the SELF, they know BRAHAMA (THE FATHER WHO IS IN SECRET) and it is clear that they go to BRAHAMA (THE FATHER).

JAINISM says that during this GREAT DAY of BRAHAMA, twenty-four MAJOR PROPHETS descend to this world who have reached TOTAL PERFECTION.

The GNOSTIC scriptures say that there are TWELVE SAVIOURS, that is: Twelve AVATARS; but if we think of a JOHN THE BAPTIST as a precursor and a JESUS as an AVATAR, for PISCES, the era that has just passed, then we can understand that for each of the twelve zodiacal eras there is always a precursor and an AVATAR, a total of twenty-four GREAT PROPHETS.

MAHAVIRA was the PRECURSOR OF BUDDHA and JOHN THE BAPTIST that of JESUS.

The SACRED RASKOARNO (DEATH), is full of deep inner beauty. Only he who has EXPERIENCED in a direct way, its deep SIGNIFICANCE, knows the TRUTH about DEATH.

The MOON takes and brings the deceased. Extremes touch. Death and conception are intimately united. The path of LIFE is formed with the footprints of the hooves of the HORSE OF DEATH.

The disintegration of all the elements that constitute the physical body originates a very special vibration that passes invisibly through space and time.

Similar to the waves of TELEVISION that carry images, are the vibratory waves of the deceased. What the screen is to the WAVES of the broadcasting stations, is the embryo to the waves of death.

The VIBRATORY WAVES OF DEATH carry the IMAGE of the deceased. This image is deposited in the fertilised egg.

Under the LUNAR INFLUENCE the ZOOSPERM penetrates through the covering of the egg, which instantaneously closes again, imprisoning it. There it generates a very interesting field of attraction, attracting and being attracted towards the feminine nucleus that silently waits in the centre of the egg.

When these two CAPITAL NUCLEI merge into a single UNITY, the CHROMOSOMES then begin their famous dance, becoming entangled and becoming entangled again in an instant. This is how the DESIGN of someone who agonised and died comes to crystallise in the embryo.

Each ordinary CELL of the human organism contains forty-eight laws of the world in which we live.

The reproductive cells of the organism only contain a single CHROMOSOME of each pair, but in their union they produce the new combination of forty-eight, which makes each embryo unique and different.

Every human form, every organism, is a precious machine. Each CHROMOSOME carries within itself the seal of some special function, quality or characteristic, a pair determines the sex, because the duality of this pair is what makes FEMALES.

The odd number of the CHROMOSOME originates males. Let us remember the Biblical legend of EVE made from a rib of ADAM and having, therefore, one more rib than him.

The CHROMOSOMES in THEMSELVES are composed of GENES and each of these, by a few molecules. Really, the GENES constitute the border between this world and the other, between the third and the fourth dimension.

The waves of the dying, the waves of death, act on the GENES, ordering them inside the FERTILISED EGG. Thus, the lost physical body is remade, thus, the design of the deceased becomes visible in the embryo.

During the CANCER season, our GNOSTIC Disciples should PRACTISE, before falling asleep in their bed, a RETROSPECTIVE EXERCISE on their own life, as if they were watching a film from the end to the beginning, or as if they were reading a book from the end to the beginning, from the last page to the first.

The purpose of this RETROSPECTIVE EXERCISE on our own life is to KNOW OURSELVES, to DISCOVER OURSELVES.

RECOGNISE our good and bad actions, study our own LUNAR EGO, make the SUB-CONSCIOUS CONSCIOUS.

It is necessary to arrive in a RETROSPECTIVE way until BIRTH and to remember it, a superior effort will allow the student to connect the BIRTH with the DEATH of his past physical body. SLEEP combined with MEDITATION, with the RETROSPECTIVE EXERCISE, will allow us to remember our current life and the past and past existences.

The RETROSPECTIVE EXERCISE allows us to become aware of our own LUNAR EGO, of our own errors. Let us remember that the EGO is a BUNCH of REMEMBRANCES, desires, passions, iras, greed, lusts, pride, laziness, gluttony, self-love, resentments, vengeances, etc.

If we want to dissolve the EGO, we must first study it. The EGO is the root of ignorance and pain.

Only the SELF, ATMAN, is PERFECT, but HE is not BORN, nor does he die, nor is he REINCARNATED; so said KRISHNA in the BHAGAVAD GITA.

If the student falls asleep during the RETROSPECTIVE EXERCISE, so much the better because in the INTERNAL WORLDS he will be able to KNOW HIMSELF, to remember his whole life and all his past lives.

Just as the MEDICAL SURGEON needs to study a cancerous tumour before removing it, so the GNOSTIC needs to study his own EGO before EXTRACTING it.

During CANCER, the forces accumulated in the BRONCHI and LUNGS by GEMINI, must now pass in CANCER to the THYMUS GLAND.

The COSMIC FORCES that ascend through our organism meet in the THYMUS GLAND with the forces that descend, and the two linked triangles, the SEAL OF SOLOMON, are formed.

The DISCIPLE must meditate daily on this SEAL OF SOLOMON forming in the THYMUS GLAND.

We have been told that the THYMUS GLAND regulates the growth of children. It is interesting that the MAMMARY GLANDS of the MOTHER are intimately related to the THYMUS GLAND. That is why breast MILK can never be replaced by any other food for the child.

Natives of CANCER have a character as variable as the phases of the MOON.

Natives of CANCER are peaceful by nature, but when they become angry they are terrible.

Natives of CANCER have a disposition for manual arts, practical arts.

Natives of CANCER have a vivid IMAGINATION, but must beware of FANTASY.

CONSCIOUS IMAGINATION is advisable. Mechanical imagination called FANTASY is absurd.

CANCERIANS have a soft, withdrawn, and shrunk nature, homely virtues.

In CANCER we sometimes find some individuals who are too passive, loose, lazy.

NATIVES OF CANCER are very fond of novels, films, etc.

The metal OF CANCER is SILVER. Stone, the PEARL; colour, WHITE.

CANCER, the sign of the CRAB or the SACRED SCARAB, is the house of the MOON.
