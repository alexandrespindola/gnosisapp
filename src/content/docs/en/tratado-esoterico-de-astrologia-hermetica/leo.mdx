## JULY 22nd TO AUGUST 23rd

ANNIE BESANT recounts a case of MASTER NANAK that is well worth transcribing.

"It was Friday that day, and when the hour of prayer arrived, master and servant made their way to the mosque. When the KARI (MUSLIM PRIEST) began the prayers, the NABAB and his retinue prostrated themselves, as prescribed by the MAHOMETAN RITE, NANAK remained standing, motionless and silent. When the prayer was finished, the NABAB turned to the young man and asked him indignantly: Why have you not fulfilled the ceremonies of the Law? You are a liar and a fraud. You should not have come here just to stand there like a post."

NANAK REPLIED:

"You prostrated yourselves face to the ground while your mind wandered in the clouds, because you were thinking about bringing horses from CANDAR, not about reciting the prayer. As for the Priest, he was automatically practising the ceremonies of prostration, while he was thinking about saving the donkey that gave birth days ago. How could I pray with people who kneel out of routine and repeat the words like a parrot?"

"The NABAB confessed that he had indeed been thinking throughout the ceremony about the planned purchase of horses. As for the KARI, he openly expressed his displeasure and pressed the young man with many questions."

It is truly necessary to learn to PRAY scientifically; whoever learns to intelligently combine PRAYER with MEDITATION will obtain wonderful OBJECTIVE results.

But it is urgent to understand that there are different PRAYERS and that their results are different.

There are PRAYERS accompanied by petitions, but not all prayers are accompanied by petitions.

There are very ancient PRAYERS that are true RECAPITULATIONS of COSMIC events and we can experience all their content if we meditate on each word, on each phrase, with true conscious devotion.

THE LORD'S PRAYER is a MAGICAL formula of immense PRIESTLY power, but it is urgent to fully and totally understand the profound meaning of each word, of each phrase, of each supplication.

THE LORD'S PRAYER is a prayer of petition, a prayer to speak with the FATHER who is in secret. THE LORD'S PRAYER combined with deep MEDITATION, produces MARVELLOUS OBJECTIVE results.

GNOSTIC RITUALS, RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES, are true treatises of HIDDEN WISDOM, for those who know how to meditate, for those who understand them with the heart.

Whoever wants to walk the PATH OF THE TRANQUIL HEART, must fix the PRANA, the LIFE, the SEXUAL FORCE in the brain and the mind in the HEART.

It is URGENT to learn to think with the heart, to deposit the mind in the HEART TEMPLE. The CROSS of INITIATION is always received in the marvellous TEMPLE of the heart.

NANAK, the Master founder of the SIKH RELIGION in the sacred land of the VEDAS, taught the way of the HEART.

NANAK taught fraternity between all RELIGIONS, Schools, sects, etc.

When we attack all Religions or in particular some religion, we commit the crime of violating the LAW of the HEART.

In the HEART-TEMPLE there is room for all RELIGIONS, SECTS, ORDERS, etc., etc., etc.

All RELIGIONS are precious pearls strung on the golden thread of DIVINITY.

Our GNOSTIC MOVEMENT is made up of people from all Religions, Schools, Sects, spiritual Societies, etc., etc., etc.

In the HEART-TEMPLE there is room for all Religions, for all cults. Jesus said: "By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

The SIKH Scriptures, like those of every RELIGION, are truly ineffable.

Among the SIKHS, OMKARA is the PRIMARY DIVINE BEING who created the sky, the earth, the waters, everything that exists.

OMKARA is the PRIMARY, UNMANIFESTED, IMPERISHABLE SPIRIT, without beginning of days, without end of days, whose Light illuminates the FOURTEEN ABODES, instantaneous knower; internal regulator of every heart".

"Space is your power. The SUN and the MOON your lamps. The army of stars your pearls. O Father! The fragrant breeze of the Himalayas is your incense. The wind fans you. The plant kingdom pays you flowers, O light! For you the hymns of praise, O destroyer of fear! The ANATAL SHABDHA (VIRGIN SOUND) resounds like your drums. You have no eyes and you have thousands of them. You have no feet and you have thousands of them. You have no nose and you have thousands of them. This your marvellous work enraptures us. Your light, O glory! is in all things. From all beings radiates the Light of your Light. From the teachings of the Master radiates this light. It is an ARATI."

The GREAT MASTER NANAK, according to the UPANISHADS, understands that BRAHAMA (THE FATHER), is ONE and that the INEFFABLE GODS are only his thousand partial manifestations, reflections of ABSOLUTE BEAUTY.

The GURÚ-DEVA is he who is already one with the FATHER (BRAHAMA). Blessed is he who has a GURÚ-DEVA as guide and orientator. Blessed is he who has found the MASTER of PERFECTION.

The path is narrow, tight and frighteningly difficult. The GURÚ-DEVA, the orientator, the guide is needed.

In the HEART-TEMPLE we will find HARI THE BEING. In the HEART-TEMPLE we will find the GURÚ-DEVA.

Now we will transcribe some SIKH stanzas about Devotion to the GURÚ-DEVA.

"O NANAK! Recognise him as the true GURÚ, the well-beloved who unites you to the all..."

"A hundred times a day I would like to sacrifice myself for my GURÚ who has made me GOD in a short time".

"Although a hundred Moons and a thousand Suns shone, deep darkness would reign without the GURÚ".

"Blessed be my Venerable GURÚ who knows HARI (THE BEING) and has taught us to treat friends and enemies equally".

"O Lord! Favour us with the company of GURÚ-DEVA, so that together with HIM we, strayed sinners, may make the crossing by swimming".

"GURÚ-DEVA, the true GURÚ, is PARABRAHMAN the Supreme Lord. NANAK prostrates himself before the GURÚ DEVA HARI".

In HINDUSTAN a SAMYASIN of thought is one who serves the true GURÚ-DEVA, who has already found him in the heart, who works in the DISSOLUTION OF THE LUNAR EGO.

Whoever wants to end the EGO, with the I, must annihilate WRATH, GREED, LUST, ENVY, PRIDE, SLOTH, GLUTTONY. Only by ending all these defects on all LEVELS of the MIND, does the I die in a RADICAL, total and definitive way.

MEDITATION on the name of HARI (THE BEING), allows us to experience the REAL, the true.

It is necessary to learn to PRAY THE LORD'S PRAYER, to learn to speak with BRAHAMA (THE FATHER) who is in secret.

A single LORD'S PRAYER well prayed and wisely combined with MEDITATION, is a whole work of high magic.

A single LORD'S PRAYER well prayed is done in an hour of time or in a little more than an hour.

After the prayer, one must know how to await the FATHER'S response and this means knowing how to meditate, having the mind still and in silence, empty of all thought, awaiting the FATHER'S response.

When the MIND is still inside and out, when the MIND is in SILENCE inside and out, when the mind has freed itself from DUALISM, then the NEW comes to us.

It is necessary to EMPTY the mind of all kinds of thoughts, desires, passions, appetites, fears, etc., so that the experience of the REAL comes to us.

The irruption of the VOID, the EXPERIENCE in the ILLUMINATING VOID, are only possible when the ESSENCE, the SOUL, the BUDHATA, is freed from the intellectual bottle.

The ESSENCE is bottled up amidst the tremendous battle of opposites: cold and heat, taste and distaste, yes and no, good and evil, pleasant and unpleasant.

When the MIND is still, when the MIND is in silence, then the ESSENCE is freed and comes the EXPERIENCE of the REAL in the ILLUMINATING VOID.

PRAY, therefore, good DISCIPLE, and then with the mind very still and in silence, EMPTY of all kinds of thoughts, await the response of the FATHER: "Ask and it will be given to you; knock and the door will be opened to you."

PRAYING is conversing with GOD and certainly one must learn to converse with the FATHER, with BRAHAMA.

The HEART TEMPLE is a house of PRAYER. In the heart temple the forces that come from above meet with the forces that come from below, forming the seal of SOLOMON.

It is necessary to pray and MEDITATE deeply. It is urgent to know how to relax the physical body so that the MEDITATION is correct.

Before starting the Practices of combined PRAYER and MEDITATION, relax the body well.

The GNOSTIC Disciple should lie down in the SUPINE position, that is, lying on his back on the floor or on a bed, legs and arms open to the right and left, in the form of a five-pointed STAR.

This PENTAGONAL STAR position is formidable because of its deep significance, but people who for some reason cannot meditate in this position, then meditate placing their body in the DEAD MAN'S POSITION: heels together, tips of the feet opening out in the form of a fan, arms against the sides without bending, placed along the trunk.

The eyes must be closed so that the things of the physical world do not distract you. Sleep properly combined with MEDITATION is very indispensable for the success of MEDITATION.

It is necessary to try to totally relax all the muscles of the body and then concentrate the ATTENTION on the tip of the nose until you fully feel the pulse of the heart in that organ of smell, then we will continue with the right ear until you feel the pulse of the heart in it, then we will continue with the right hand, right foot, left foot, left hand, left ear and again, fully feeling the pulse of the heart separately in each of these organs where we have focused the ATTENTION.

Control over the physical body begins with control over the pulse. The pulse of the tranquil heart is felt at once in its entirety within the organism, but the GNOSTICS can feel it at will in any part of the body, be it the tip of the nose, an ear, an arm, a foot, etc.

It is demonstrated by practice that by acquiring the possibility of regulating, accelerating or decreasing the pulse, the heartbeats can be accelerated or decreased.

Control over the heart's palpitations can never come from the muscles of the heart, but depends entirely on the control of the pulse. This is beyond any doubt, the SECOND BEAT or GREAT HEART.

The control of the pulse or control of the second heart, is achieved totally through the ABSOLUTE RELAXATION of all the muscles.

Through ATTENTION we can accelerate or decrease the PULSATIONS of the SECOND HEART and the beats of the first heart.

SHAMADHÍ, ECSTASY, SATORI, always occur with very slow pulsations, and in the MAHA-SHAMADHÍ the pulsations end.

During SHAMADHÍ the ESSENCE, the BUDHATA, escapes from the PERSONALITY, then it FUSES with the BEING and comes the EXPERIENCE of the REAL in the ILLUMINATING VOID.

Only in the absence of the I can we talk with the FATHER, the BRAHAMA.

PRAY and MEDITATE, so that you can hear the VOICE of SILENCE.

LEO is the throne of the SUN, the heart of the ZODIAC. LEO governs the human heart.

The SUN of the organism is the HEART. In the heart the forces from above mix with those from below, so that those from below can be liberated.

The metal of LEO is pure GOLD. The stone of LEO is the DIAMOND; the colour of LEO is GOLDEN.

In practice we have been able to verify that the natives of LEO are like the LION, brave, wrathful, noble, dignified, constant.

However, there are many people and it is clear that among the natives of LEO we also find haughty, proud, unfaithful, tyrannical, etc.

The natives of LEO have aptitudes as organisers, they develop the feeling and the bravery of the LION. The developed people of this sign, become GREAT PALADINS.

The mediocre type of LEO is very sentimental and wrathful. The mediocre type of LEO overestimates his own capabilities too much.

In every native of LEO there always exists the MYSTICISM, already elevated in an incipient state; everything depends on the type of person.

The natives of LEO are always predisposed to suffer accidents of the arms and hands.
