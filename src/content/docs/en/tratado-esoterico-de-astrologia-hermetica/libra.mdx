23rd OF SEPTEMBER TO 23rd OF OCTOBER

The decrepit Western mind, in creating the UNYIELDING DOGMA of EVOLUTION, completely forgot about the destructive processes of Nature. It is curious that the degenerate mind cannot conceive of the inverse, INVOLUTIONARY process, on a LARGE SCALE.

The mind in a state of decrepitude confuses a fall with a descent and qualifies the process of destruction, dissolution on a large scale, degeneration, etc., as change, progress, EVOLUTION.

Everything EVOLVES and INVOLVES, rises and falls, grows and shrinks, goes and comes, flows and ebbs; in everything there is a systole and a diastole, according to the Law of the pendulum.

EVOLUTION and its twin sister INVOLUTION, are two Laws that develop and process in a coordinated and harmonious way in all that is created.

EVOLUTION and INVOLUTION constitute the mechanical axis of nature.

EVOLUTION and INVOLUTION are two mechanical laws of nature that have nothing to do with the INTIMATE SELF-REALISATION of man.

The INTIMATE SELF-REALISATION of man can never be the product of any mechanical Law, but the result of a conscious work, done on oneself and within ONESELF, based on TREMENDOUS SUPER-EFFORTS, deep understanding and intentional and voluntary sufferings.

Everything RETURNS to the original starting point and the LUNAR EGO returns after death to a new matrix.

It is written that every human being is assigned ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT lives to SELF-REALISE. Time is running out for many people. Whoever does not SELF-REALISE within their allotted time, ceases to be born to enter the INFERNAL WORLDS.

In support of the LAW of INVOLUTION or regression comes the BHAGAVAD GITA saying: "To them, the wicked, cruel and degraded, I cast, perpetually in the ASURIC (DEMONIC) WOMBS, to be born in these worlds" (INFERNAL WORLDS).

"Oh Kountreya!, those hallucinated people go to the Demonic matrices for many lives and continue to fall into increasingly inferior bodies." (INVOLUTION).

"Triple is the door of this destructive hell; it is made of lust, anger and greed; therefore it must be abandoned."

The anteroom of the INFERNAL WORLDS is the INVOLUTIONARY descent in increasingly inferior bodies according to the LAW of INVOLUTION.

Those who descend the spiral of life fall into Demonic matrices for several lives before entering the INFERNAL WORLDS of NATURE, located by DANTE within the interior of the terrestrial organism.

In the second chapter we already spoke about the SACRED COW and its deep significance; it is very curious that every BRAHMAN in INDIA, when praying the ROSARY counts one hundred and eight beads of it.

There are INDOS who do not consider their sacred duties fulfilled, unless they give around the MAIN COW, one hundred and eight turns with the ROSARY in their hands, and yes, filling a cup of water and putting it for a moment on the tail of the COW, they do not drink it, as the most sacred and delicious Divine liquor.

It is URGENT to remember that the BUDDHA's necklace has ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT BEADS. All this invites us to reflect on the ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT LIVES that are assigned to the HUMAN BEING.

It is clear that whoever does not take advantage of those ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT LIVES, enters the INVOLUTION of the INFERNAL WORLDS.

INFERNAL INVOLUTION is a falling backwards, towards the past, passing through all the animal, vegetable and mineral states, through frightful sufferings.

The last stage of INFERNAL INVOLUTION is the fossil state, then comes the DISINTEGRATION of the lost.

The only thing that is SAVED from all that tragedy, the only thing that does NOT disintegrate is the ESSENCE, the BUDHATA, that FRACTION OF HUMAN SOUL that the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL carries inside its LUNAR BODIES.

INVOLUTION in the INFERNAL WORLDS has precisely the purpose of liberating the BUDHATA, the HUMAN SOUL, so that from the original chaos it can restart its EVOLUTIONARY ascent through the mineral, vegetable, animal scales, until it reaches the level of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called MAN.

It is regrettable that many SOULS relapse, return again and again to the INFERNAL WORLDS.

Time in the INFERNAL WORLDS of the SUBMERGED MINERAL KINGDOM is frightfully slow and boring; every ONE HUNDRED frightfully long YEARS in those ATOMIC HELLS of nature, a certain amount of KARMA is paid.

Whoever completely disintegrates in the INFERNAL WORLDS, is at peace and safe with the LAW OF KARMA.

After the death of the PHYSICAL BODY, every human being after reviewing the life he has just passed, is JUDGED by the LORDS OF KARMA. The lost enter the INFERNAL WORLDS after their good and bad works have been placed on the scales of COSMIC JUSTICE.

The LAW OF THE SCALES, the TERRIBLE LAW OF KARMA, governs all that is created. Every cause becomes an effect and every effect is transformed into a cause.

By modifying the CAUSE, the EFFECT is MODIFIED. Do good works so that you pay your debts.

The LION OF THE LAW is fought with the scales. If the plate of bad works weighs more, I advise you to increase the weight in the plate of good works, thus you will tip the scales in your favour.

Whoever has CAPITAL to pay with, pays and does well in business; whoever does not have CAPITAL, must pay with pain.

When a LOWER LAW is transcended by a HIGHER LAW, the HIGHER LAW WASHES the LOWER LAW.

Millions of people talk about the LAWS of REINCARNATION and KARMA, without having experienced directly their deep SIGNIFICANCE.

Really the LUNAR EGO RETURNS, is REINCORPORATED, penetrates into a new matrix, but that cannot be called REINCARNATION; speaking with precision we will say that that is RETURN.

REINCARNATION is something else; REINCARNATION is only for MASTERS, for SACRED INDIVIDUALS, for the TWICE BORN, for those who already possess the BEING.

The LUNAR EGO returns and according to the LAW of RECURRENCE, repeats in each life the same actions, the same dramas of the preceding lives.

The SPIRAL LINE is the line of life and each life is repeated either in higher, EVOLUTIONARY SPIRALS or in lower, INVOLUTIONARY SPIRALS.

Each life is a repetition of the past, plus its good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant consequences.

Many people in a resolute and definitive way, descend from life to life along the involutive spiral line, until they finally enter the INFERNAL WORLDS.

Whoever wants to SELF-REALISE in depth, must free himself from the vicious circle of the EVOLUTIONARY and INVOLUTIONARY LAWS of nature.

Whoever TRULY wants to leave the STATE of INTELLECTUAL-ANIMAL, whoever very sincerely wants to become a TRUE MAN, must free himself from the MECHANICAL LAWS of nature.

Everyone who wants to become TWICE BORN, everyone who wants INTIMATE SELF-REALISATION, must enter the path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS; this is the path of the EDGE OF THE RAZOR. This path is full of dangers inside and outside.

The DHAMMAPADA says: "Of men, few are those who reach the other shore. The others walk on this shore, running from one side to the other".

Jesus the Christ says: "Of a thousand who seek me, one finds me, of a thousand who find me, one... follows me, of a thousand who follow me, one is mine".

The BHAGAVAD GITA says: "Among thousands of men perhaps one tries to reach perfection; among those who try, possibly one achieves perfection, and among the perfect, perhaps one knows ME perfectly".

The DIVINE RABBI OF GALILEE never said that the LAW of EVOLUTION would lead all human beings to perfection. JESUS, in the four gospels emphasises the difficulty of entering the KINGDOM.

"Strive to enter through the narrow gate, because I tell you that many will try to enter, and will not be able".

"After the master of the house has risen up and shut the door, and you are outside and begin to knock on the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, He will answer you, 'I do not know where you are from'.

"Then you will begin to say: We have eaten and drunk before you, and you taught in our squares".

"But He will say to you: I tell you, I do not know where you are from; depart from me all you workers of iniquity".

"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the KINGDOM OF GOD, and you excluded".

The LAW OF NATURAL SELECTION exists in all that is created; not all the students who enter a faculty graduate as professionals.

CHRIST JESUS never said that the LAW of EVOLUTION would lead all human beings to the final goal.

Some PSEUDO-ESOTERICISTS and PSEUDO-OCCULTISTS say that through many paths one reaches GOD. This is really a SOPHISM with which they always want to justify their own errors.

The GREAT HIEROPHANT JESUS the CHRIST only pointed out one door and one path: "Narrow is the door and narrow the path that leads to the LIGHT and very few are those who find it".

The DOOR and the PATH are sealed by a great STONE, blessed is he who can move that STONE, but that is not a matter of this lesson, that belongs to the lesson of Scorpio, now we are studying the zodiac sign of the SCALES, the sign of LIBRA.

We need to become aware of our own KARMA and that is only possible through the STATE OF ALERT NOVELTY.

Every EFFECT of life, every event, has its cause in a previous life, but we need to become aware of that.

Every moment of JOY or PAIN must be continued in MEDITATION with a QUIET mind and in DEEP SILENCE. The RESULT comes to be the experimentation of the same event in a previous life. Then we become CONSCIOUS of the CAUSE of the event, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant.

Whoever awakens CONSCIOUSNESS, can travel in his INTERNAL BODIES outside the PHYSICAL BODY, at FULL CONSCIOUS WILL and study his own book of destiny.

In the TEMPLE OF ANUBIS and his FORTY-TWO JUDGES, the INITIATE can study his own book.

ANUBIS is the SUPREME RULER of KARMA. The temple of ANUBIS is located in the MOLECULAR WORLD, called by many people ASTRAL WORLD.

INITIATES can negotiate directly with ANUBIS. We can cancel all Karmic debt with GOOD WORKS, but we must negotiate with ANUBIS.

The LAW OF KARMA, the LAW of the COSMIC SCALES is not a blind LAW; CREDIT can also be requested from the LORDS OF KARMA, but all CREDIT must be paid with good works and if it is not paid, then the LAW collects it with pain.

LIBRA, the zodiac sign of the SCALES, governs the KIDNEYS. LIBRA is the sign of the balancing forces and in the kidneys the forces of our organism must be totally balanced.

Stand up, in military position of attention and then with your arms extended in the form of a CROSS, or of SCALES, move in the form of SCALES leaning seven times to the right and seven times to the left with the intention that all your forces are balanced in the kidneys. The movement of the upper half of the spinal column should be like that of a scale.

The forces that rise from the earth passing through the sieve of our feet along the entire organism, must be balanced at the waist and this is successfully achieved by the SWINGING MOVEMENT of LIBRA.

LIBRA is governed by VENUS and SATURN. Metal, copper. Stone, the CHRYSOLITE.

In practice we have been able to verify that the natives of LIBRA usually, for the most part, have a certain imbalance in what is related to conjugal life, love.

The natives of LIBRA create many problems for themselves because of their frank and JUSTICE-SEEKING way of being.

The well-aspected LIBRANS like straight, fair things. People do not understand the LIBRANS well, they sometimes seem cruel and ruthless, they do not know nor do they want to know about diplomacy, hypocrisy annoys them, the sweet words of the perverse easily anger them instead of softening them.

LIBRANS have the defect of not knowing how to forgive their neighbour, in everything they want to see Law and nothing but law, often forgetting mercy.

The NATIVES OF LIBRA like to travel very much and are faithful fulfillers of their duties.

The natives of LIBRA are what they are and nothing more than what they are, frank and justice-seeking. People tend to get angry with the natives of LIBRA, they are misinterpreted because of this way of being and as is natural they are spoken badly of and they tend to fill themselves with gratuitous enemies.

One cannot come to the LIBRAN with DOUBLE GAMES, the LIBRAN does not tolerate that and does not forgive it.

With the LIBRANS one must always be kind and affectionate or always severe, but never with that double game of sweetness and harshness, because the LIBRAN does not tolerate that and never forgives it.

The SUPERIOR type of LIBRA always confers TOTAL CHASTITY. The inferior type of LIBRA is very fornicating and adulterous.

The superior type of LIBRA has a certain SPIRITUALITY that SPIRITUALISTS do not understand and judge wrongly.

The negative inferior type of LIBRA, has dazzling and unknown people, never feels any attraction for fame, for laurels, for prestige.

The superior type of LIBRA reveals PRUDENCE and the sense of foresight and saving. The inferior type of LIBRA has much superficiality and greed.

In the middle type of LIBRA many qualities and defects of the two superior and inferior types of LIBRA tend to be mixed.

The natives of LIBRA are well suited for marriage with Pisces.

The natives of LIBRA like to do charitable works without expecting reward or boasting or publishing the service done.

The superior type of LIBRA loves select music, recreates in it and enjoys it to the highest degree.

LIBRANS also feel attraction for good theatre, good literature, etc., etc., etc.
