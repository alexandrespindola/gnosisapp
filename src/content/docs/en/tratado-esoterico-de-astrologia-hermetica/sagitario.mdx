22ND NOVEMBER TO 21ST DECEMBER

From Geber to the enigmatic and powerful COUNT CAGLIOSTRO, who transmuted lead into gold and manufactured diamonds of the finest quality, there existed a long line of ALCHEMISTS and researchers of the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE (SEX).

It is quite clear that only those wise men who dissolved the LUNAR EGO and despised the vanities of this world, had true success in their investigations.

Among all those ALCHEMISTS and VICTORIOUS ADEPTS who worked in the laboratory of SEXUAL ALCHEMY, BASIL VALENTINE, RIPLEY, BACON, HONKS ROGER, etc. stand out.

NICOLAS FLAMEL is still much discussed; some suppose that he did not reach the difficult goal during his life... as he refused to reveal his secret to the King, he ended his days locked up in the terrible BASTILLE.

We are frankly convinced that NICOLAS FLAMEL, the great ALCHEMIST, managed to transmute all the LEAD of his PERSONALITY into the wonderful GOLD of the SPIRIT.

Trevisan, the famous Trevisan, spent his entire fortune seeking the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE and managed to discover the secret at the age of seventy-five, already too late.

The PHILOSOPHER'S STONE is sex and the secret is MAITHUNA, SEXUAL MAGIC, but poor Trevisan, despite possessing a formidable intelligence, only came to discover the secret in old age.

Paracelsus, disciple of Trithemius, great Medical Alchemist, knew the secret of the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, transmuted lead into gold and performed surprising healings.

Many suppose that Paracelsus died a violent death, by assassination or suicide, for having revealed a part of the Mysteries, but the reality is that Paracelsus disappeared without knowing how or why.

All of US know that Paracelsus achieved what is called ELIXIR OF LONG LIFE and that with this MARVELLOUS elixir he still sustains himself, he lives with the same physical body he had in the MIDDLE AGES.

Schrotpffer and Savater practised certain magical rites that were too dangerous and caused their violent deaths without having Self-realised themselves thoroughly.

The famous Dr J. Dee sought the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE and never found it, but was reduced to the most appalling misery. In the last years of his life, the poor doctor degenerated horribly with MEDIUMSHIP and became a toy of the inferior entities that live in the molecular world.

SETON was condemned for refusing to reveal the secret of the PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. Dr PRISE, of the ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON, managed to TRANSMUTE PHYSICAL LEAD into MATERIAL GOLD, but when he tried to repeat the experiment before his colleagues, he failed and then, ashamed and desperate, committed suicide.

DELISLE, the great DELISLE, for similar reasons, was imprisoned and when he tried to escape from the horrible dungeon where he was locked up, he was killed by the guards.

All these FAILURES and hundreds of others, reveal that TRUE PRACTICAL OCCULTISM and its terrible magical powers, demand the most appalling SANCTITY, without which it is impossible to face the dangers of ALKIMIA and MAGIC.

Talking about SANCTITY in these times is very difficult, because the world is full of stupid hypocrites who presume to be SAINTS.

The GREAT MASTER of the force called MORIA, talking to us in EASTERN TIBET, told us: "TO UNITE WITH THE INNER SELF IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT, OF TWO WHO TRY TO UNITE WITH THE INNER SELF, ONLY ONE ACHIEVES IT, BECAUSE AS THE POET GUILLERMO VALENCIA SAID, AMONG THE CADENCES OF THE VERSE THE CRIME IS ALSO HIDDEN".

The crime is dressed as a SAINT, a MARTYR, an APOSTLE. Millions of people fond of occult literature presume to be SAINTS, they do not eat meat, they do not smoke, they do not drink, but at home they fight with their spouse and their spouse, they hit their sons and daughters, they fornicate, they commit adultery, they do not pay their debts, they promise and do not fulfil, etc., etc., etc.

In the physical world many people have reached ABSOLUTE CHASTITY, but when these people are put to the test in the internal worlds, they turn out to be frightfully fornicators.

Many are the devotees of the path who in the physical world would never take a glass of wine, but in the internal worlds they turn out to be LOST DRUNKARDS when they are put to the test.

Many are the devotees of the path who in the physical world are meek sheep, but when they are put to the test, in the internal worlds, they turn out to be true tigers.

Many are the devotees of the path who do not covet money, but they do covet psychic powers.

In the world there are many devotees of the path who amaze with their humility, they can sleep peacefully on the floor, at the door of a rich man and be content with the crumbs of bread that fall from the master's table, but they have the pride of possessing many virtues or presume to be humble.

Many people have aspired to SANCTITY when they have learned that there are cases of TRUE SAINTS. Many are those who envy the SANCTITY of others and therefore want to be SAINTS too.

Many individuals do not work on the DISSOLUTION of the LUNAR EGO out of pure mental laziness.

Countless aspirants to the LIGHT eat three banquets a day, they are terribly gluttonous.

Many do not murmur with their lips, but they murmur with their minds, and yet they believe that they never murmur.

Rare are the aspirants who know how to obey the FATHER who is in secret. Almost all occultism students, wanting to tell the truth, lie, they have a lying tongue, they affirm what they have not experienced and that is a lie.

Nowadays it is very common to put up false witnesses and occultism students do it without knowing that they are committing a crime.

Vanity also dresses in rags and there are many aspirants who dress badly and walk the streets in complete disarray, but through the holes in their clothes their vanity can also be seen.

Countless aspirants have not been able to leave SELF-LOVE, they love themselves too much and suffer unbearably when someone slights them.

A multitude of aspirants are full of bad thoughts, they have not learned to control their minds and, yet, they believe they are doing very well.

Countless PSEUDO-ESOTERICISTS and PSEUDO-OCCULTISTS, if they are not stingy with money, are then stingy with knowledge, they have not been able to transcend AVARICE.

Thousands of aspirants carry WORLDLINESS within themselves, even though they never attend a dance, a party.

Many devotees of the path have not been able to give up plunder; they steal books, they get into all the Esoteric Schools to take something, even if they are theories, secrets, they feign loyalty while they carry out their plundering work and then they do not return.

Countless devotees say bad words, some only pronounce them mentally, even though their lips speak sweetness.

Many VIRTUOSI are cruel to people. We knew of a case of a VIRTUOSO who hurt an unfortunate man with harsh phrases who composed a verse for him.

The unfortunate man was hungry and as he was a poet, he composed a verse to the VIRTUOSO with the purpose of getting a coin, the answer was grave, the virtuoso, presuming to be modest and humble, insulted the hungry man.

A multitude of aspirants to the light are vexed and cruelly humiliated by the preceptors of certain schools.

There are many people who would be capable of anything in life, except killing someone, but they kill with their ironies, with their bad actions, with the laugh that hurts, with the harsh word.

There are many husbands who have killed their wives with their bad actions, with their bad conduct, with their horrible jealousy, with ingratitude, etc.

There are many wives who have killed their husbands with their bad temper, with their clumsy jealousy, with their inconsiderate demands, etc., etc., etc.

We must not forget that every disease has psychic causes. Insult, irony, the loud and offensive laughter, bad words serve to cause damage, diseases, to murder, etc.

Many fathers and mothers would have lived a little longer, if their children had allowed it.

Almost all human beings unconsciously are MATRICIDES, PARRICIDES, FRATRICIDES, UXORICIDES, etc., etc.

There is a lack of PIETY in the students of occultism, they are incapable of sacrificing themselves for their fellow men who suffer and cry.

There is no true CHARITY in thousands of aspirants, they presume to be charitable, but when we call them to struggles to establish a new social order in the world, they flee in terror or justify themselves saying that the law of Karma and Evolution will solve everything.

The aspirants to the light are cruel, ruthless, they say they love and they do not love, they preach charity, but they do not practice it.

The sign of SAGITTARIUS invites us to reflect on all this. Sagittarius is symbolised by a man who has an arrow in his hand, half horse, half man.

The horse represents the ANIMAL EGO, PLURALISED I dressed in its LUNAR BODIES.

The I is not something INDIVIDUAL, the I has no INDIVIDUALITY. The I is PLURAL, the LUNAR EGO is constituted by a sum of small IOUs. Each psychological defect is personified by a small I. The set of all our defects is represented by the PLURALISED I.

The most serious problem that everyone who attains the SECOND BIRTH has to solve is that of DISSOLVING the LUNAR EGO.

The newly born MASTER is dressed in his SOLAR BODIES, but his EGO is dressed in the LUNAR BODIES.

Before the newly born MASTER two paths open, the one on the right and the one on the left.

Along the path on the right walk those MASTERS who work on the DISSOLUTION of the LUNAR EGO. Along the path on the left walk those who DO NOT WORRY about the dissolution of the LUNAR EGO.

MASTERS who DO NOT dissolve the LUNAR EGO, become HANASMUSSENS. A HANASMUSSEN is a subject with DOUBLE CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

The MASTER dressed in his SOLAR BODIES and the LUNAR EGO dressed in its LUNAR vehicles, constitute a double personality, a HANASMUSSEN.

The HANASMUSSEN is half ANGEL half beast, like the centaur of SAGITTARIUS. The HANASMUSSEN has two INTERNAL personalities, one of ANGEL, the other of DEMON.

The HANASMUSSEN is an ABORTION of the COSMIC MOTHER, a FAILURE. If the GNOSTIC student dissolves the LUNAR EGO before the SECOND BIRTH, he heals himself in health, solves his problem in advance, ensures success.

Whoever invokes ANDRAMELEK in the internal worlds will have the most tremendous surprise, because the DEMON ANDRAMELEK or the MASTER of the WHITE LODGE may attend. This subject is a HANASMUSSEN with DOUBLE CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

Dissolving the LUNAR EGO is basic in the GREAT WORK. Those who attain the SECOND BIRTH feel the need to eliminate the LUNAR BODIES, but this is not possible without having first dissolved the LUNAR EGO.

The twice BORN stagnate in their inner progress when they lack LOVE.

Everyone who forgets their DIVINE MOTHER stagnates in their progress. There is a lack of LOVE when we make the mistake of forgetting our DIVINE MOTHER.

It is impossible to eliminate all the small IOUs that constitute the LUNAR EGO without the help of the DIVINE MOTHER.

Understanding any defect is basic, indispensable, when one wants to eliminate the small I that personifies it, but the work of elimination in ONE'S SELF is impossible without the help of the SACRED COW of the five legs.

The DIVINE MOTHER eliminates broken bottles. Each small I is a bottle inside which a fraction of the ESSENCE is bottled.

This means that the ESSENCE, the BUDHATA, the SOUL or FRACTION of the HUMAN SOUL that every INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL has, has become thousands of fractions that are bottled.

EXAMPLE: ANGER is represented by hundreds OR thousands of IOUs, each one is a bottle inside which the ESSENCE is bottled; each bottle corresponds to a fraction of the ESSENCE.

All those bottles of ANGER, all those IOUs, live in each of the forty-nine departments or regions of the SUBCONSCIOUS.

Understanding ANGER in any SUBCONSCIOUS department means breaking a bottle; then the corresponding fraction of the ESSENCE is released.

When this happens, the DIVINE MOTHER intervenes by eliminating the broken bottle, the corpse of the destroyed small I. This corpse no longer has inside it the fraction of the SOUL that it previously imprisoned and little by little it disintegrates in the HELL-WORLDS.

It is necessary to know that the DIVINE MOTHER only intervenes in this case, when the bottle is destroyed, when the ESSENCE enclosed in it has been released.

If the DIVINE MOTHER eliminated the bottle with the GENIE inside, the poor GENIE, that is, the FRACTION OF THE SOUL, would also have to enter the HELL worlds.

When all the bottles have been broken, the ESSENCE in its entirety has been LIBERATED and the DIVINE MOTHER dedicates herself to eliminating corpses.

Understanding ANGER in twenty or thirty subconscious regions does not mean having understood it in all forty-nine departments.

UNDERSTANDING ANGER in DEPARTMENT THREE or FOUR means breaking, breaking a bottle whether in department three or four. However, many IOUs of ANGER, many bottles, can continue in all the other SUBCONSCIOUS departments.

Each DEFECT is processed in each of the forty-nine regions of the SUBCONSCIOUS and has many roots.

ANGER, AVARICE, LUST, ENVY, PRIDE, SLOTH, GLUTTONY, have thousands of bottles, thousands of small IOUs inside which the ESSENCE is bottled.

When the PLURALISED I is dead and eliminated, the ESSENCE unites with the BEING, with the INNER SELF and the LUNAR BODIES are eliminated during a mystical trance that lasts three days.

After THREE DAYS the MASTER, dressed in his SOLAR BODIES, returns, returns to his PHYSICAL BODY. This is the INITIATIC RESURRECTION.

Every RESURRECTED MASTER has SOLAR BODIES, but does NOT have LUNAR BODIES.

RESURRECTED MASTERS have powers over FIRE, AIR, WATERS and EARTH.

RESURRECTED MASTERS can TRANSMUTE physical LEAD into physical GOLD.

RESURRECTED MASTERS govern LIFE and DEATH, they can preserve the physical body for millions of years, they know the quadrature of the circle and perpetual motion, they have universal medicine and speak in the purest East of the DIVINE LANGUAGE which, like a river of gold, runs deliciously under the thick jungle of the SUN.

Whoever is dying from moment to moment is subjected to thousands of esoteric tests in each of the forty-nine subconscious departments of JALDABAOTH.

Many initiates, after emerging victorious in a few departments or regions of the SUBCONSCIOUS, fail in a few departments in such or such tests related to such or such Psychological defect.

The DIVINE MOTHER always helps us to UNDERSTAND when we call her on the flame of the SERPENT.

The DIVINE MOTHER prays for us to the WHITE LODGE and eliminates one by one those IOUs that have already died.

The DIVINE MOTHER, the SACRED COW, of the five legs, is the MOTHER-SPACE, the MOTHER of the SPIRITUAL MONAD that takes refuge in the eternal NOTHINGNESS-EVERYTHING of the INEFFABLE FATHER, in the ABSOLUTE SILENCE and the ABSOLUTE DARKNESS.

If we have our PARTICULAR MATERNAL RAY, our INDIVIDUAL DIVINE MOTHER, it is precisely because she in HERSELF is the MOTHER of the INTIMATE BEING, hidden inside the MONAD, one with the MONAD.

If ARTEMIS LOQUIA or NEITER was the MOON in the sky, for the Greeks the chaste DIANA on earth was the DIVINE MOTHER presiding over the birth and life of the child and for the EGYPTIANS it was HECATE in HELL, the GODDESS of DEATH, who reigned over the ENCHANTMENTS and sacred MAGIC.

HECATE-DIANA-MOON is the TRINE DIVINE MOTHER, as well as ONE, in the manner of the HINDUSTANI TRIMURTI, BRAHAMA, VISHNU-SHIVA.

The DIVINE MOTHER is ISIS, the CERES of the MYSTERIES OF ELEUSIS, the CELESTIAL VENUS; she who in the beginning of the world originated the attraction of the opposite sexes and propagated with eternal fecundity the human generations.

She is PROSERPINE, the one of the nocturnal barks, the one who in her triple CELESTIAL, TERRESTRIAL and INFERNAL appearance, oppresses the terrible demons of AVERNUS, keeping closed the doors of the subterranean prisons and triumphantly touring the SACRED FORESTS.

Sovereign of the STYGIAN ABODE, she shines in the midst of the darkness of the ACHERON, just as on the earth and the Elysian Fields.

Due to a certain mistake of some SACRED INDIVIDUALS, in ARCHAIC times the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL received the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN.

This organ is the TAIL of SATAN, the sexual fire heading downwards, towards the ATOMIC HELLS of the LUNAR EGO.

When the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL lost the KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN, the bad consequences remained inside each subject; these bad consequences are constituted by the PLURALISED I, the LUNAR EGO.

On the basis of UNDERSTANDING OF DEPTH, and deep INNER MEDITATION, we can and must eliminate from ourselves with the help of the DIVINE MOTHER, the bad consequences of the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN.

In other times the human being did not want to live in this world, he had realised his tragic situation; certain SACRED INDIVIDUALS gave the human race the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN, so that they would be deluded by the beauties of this world. The result was that the human being was deluded by the world.

When those SACRED INDIVIDUALS took the KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN away from humanity, the bad CONSEQUENCES remained inside each person.

With the HELP of the DIVINE MOTHER we can eliminate the bad consequences of the ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN.

The SIGN of SAGITTARIUS, with its famous centaur, half MAN, half BEAST, is something that must never be forgotten.

SAGITTARIUS is the house of JUPITER. The metal of SAGITTARIUS is TIN, the BLUE SAPPHIRE stone.

In practice we have been able to verify that the natives of SAGITTARIUS are very fornicating and passionate.

The natives of SAGITTARIUS love travel, explorations, adventures, sports.

The natives of SAGITTARIUS get angry easily and then forgive.

The natives of SAGITTARIUS are very UNDERSTANDING, they love beautiful music, they possess wonderful intelligence.

SAGITTARIANS are tenacious, when they seem to have definitively failed, they seem to resurrect from their own ashes like the PHOENIX from MYTHOLOGY, leaving all their friends and enemies amazed.

The natives of SAGITTARIUS are capable of embarking on GREAT ENTERPRISES, even when they are surrounded by immense dangers.

The economic life of the SAGITTARIANS is sometimes very good but SAGITTARIANS also go through great bitterness and economic difficulties.

What most harms SAGITTARIANS is LUST.

PRACTICE. Sit down in a squat, in the manner of the PERUVIAN HUACAS; put your hands on your legs, with your index fingers pointing upwards, towards the sky, to attract the RAYS of the PLANET JUPITER, in order to magnetise the legs, the femorals, intensely.

The MANTRAM ISIS is the MANTRAM of this practice. ISIS is the DIVINE MOTHER.

This MANTRAM is pronounced by lengthening the sound of each of the four letters that compose it, iiiiiissssss iiiiiissssss distributed in two syllables IS-IS.

With this exercise clairvoyance and the power of POLYVIDENCE are awakened, which allows us all to study the AKHASHIC ARCHIVES of nature to know the history of the earth and its races.

It is necessary to practice intensely, daily, to magnetise the blood in the femoral arteries. Thus the power to study in the memory of NATURE is acquired.

The CENTAUR with its two faces, one looking forward and one looking back, is indicating to us this precious faculty of CLAIRVOYANCE.
