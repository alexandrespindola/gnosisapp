21st OF MARCH TO 20th OF APRIL

There are four states of CONSCIOUSNESS possible for man: SLEEP, WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS, SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

Imagine for a moment, dear reader, a house with four floors. The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called MAN normally lives on the two lower floors, but never in his life uses the two upper floors.

The INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL divides his painful and miserable life between ordinary sleep and the misnamed state of WAKING, which is unfortunately another form of sleep.

While the physical body sleeps in bed, the EGO wrapped in its LUNAR BODIES walks with a sleeping consciousness like a sleepwalker moving freely through the molecular region. The EGO in the molecular region projects DREAMS and lives in them, there is no logic in its DREAMS, continuity, causes, effects, all PSYCHIC functions work without any direction and subjective images, incoherent, vague, imprecise scenes, etc. appear and disappear.

When the EGO wrapped in its LUNAR BODIES returns to the PHYSICAL BODY, then comes the second state of consciousness called the WAKING state, which in essence is nothing more than another form of sleep.

When the EGO returns to its PHYSICAL BODY, the dreams continue inside, the so-called WAKING STATE is really DAYDREAMING.

When the Sun rises, the stars hide, but they do not cease to exist; so are dreams in the waking state, they continue secretly, they do not cease to exist.

This means that the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called MAN only lives in the world of dreams; with good reason the Poet said that life is a dream.

The RATIONAL ANIMAL drives cars dreaming, works in the factory, in the office, in the field, etc., dreaming, falls in love in dreams, marries in dreams; rarely, very rarely in life, is he awake, lives in a world of dreams and firmly believes that he is awake.

The Four Gospels demand AWAKENING, but unfortunately, they do not say how to AWAKEN.

First of all, it is necessary to understand that one is asleep; only when someone becomes fully aware that he is asleep, does he really enter the path of AWAKENING.

Whoever comes to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS, then becomes SELF-CONSCIOUS, acquires CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF.

The most serious error of many ignorant PSEUDO ESOTERICISTS and PSEUDO OCCULTISTS is to presume to be SELF-CONSCIOUS and also to believe that everyone is awake, that all people possess SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.

If all people had AWAKENED CONSCIOUSNESS, the Earth would be a paradise, there would be no wars, there would be no mine or yours, everything would belong to everyone, we would live in a GOLDEN AGE.

When one AWAKENS CONSCIOUSNESS, when one becomes SELF-CONSCIOUS, when one acquires CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIMSELF, it is then that one really comes to know the TRUTH about oneself.

Before reaching the third state of CONSCIOUSNESS (SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS), one really does not know HIMSELF, even if he believes that he knows himself.

It is essential to acquire the third state of consciousness, to climb to the third floor of the house, before having the right to move to the fourth floor.

The FOURTH STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, the FOURTH FLOOR of the house, is really FORMIDABLE. Only those who reach OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS, the FOURTH STATE, can study things in themselves, the world as it is.

Whoever reaches the fourth floor of the house, is without a doubt an ENLIGHTENED one, knows by direct experience the MYSTERIES OF LIFE AND DEATH, possesses WISDOM, his SPATIAL sense is fully developed.

During DEEP SLEEP we can have flashes of the WAKING STATE. During the WAKING STATE we can have flashes of SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. During the STATE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS we can have flashes of OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

If we want to reach the AWAKENING OF CONSCIOUSNESS, to SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, we have to work with CONSCIOUSNESS here and now. It is precisely here in this physical world where we must work to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS, whoever awakens here awakens everywhere, in all dimensions of the Universe.

The HUMAN ORGANISM is a LIVING ZODIAC and in each of its twelve constellations, consciousness sleeps deeply.

It is urgent to awaken consciousness in each of the twelve parts of the human organism and that is what the zodiacal exercises are for.

Aries, governs the head; Taurus, the throat; Gemini, the arms, legs and lungs; Cancer, the thymus gland; Leo the heart; Virgo, the abdomen, the intestines; Libra, the kidneys; Scorpio, the sexual organs; Sagittarius, the femoral arteries; Capricorn, the knees; Aquarius, the calves; Pisces, the feet.

It is really regrettable that this living zodiac of the MICRO-COSMOS man sleeps so deeply. It becomes indispensable to achieve, based on tremendous SUPER-EFFORTS, the AWAKENING OF CONSCIOUSNESS in each of our twelve ZODIAC SIGNS.

Light and Consciousness are two phenomena of the same thing; the lower the degree of Consciousness, the lower the degree of light; the higher the degree of Consciousness, the higher the degree of light.

We need to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS to make each of the twelve parts of our own MICRO-COSMIC zodiac shine and twinkle. Our entire zodiac must become light and splendour.

The work with our own Zodiac begins precisely with ARIES. The DISCIPLE sits in a comfortable armchair with a quiet and silent mind, empty of all kinds of thoughts. The devotee closes his eyes so that nothing of the world distracts him, imagine that the purest light of ARIES floods his brain, remain in that state of meditation for as long as he wants then he will chant the powerful Mantram AUM opening his mouth well with the A, rounding it with the U and closing it with the holy M.

The powerful Mantram AUM is in itself a TERRIBLY DIVINE creation, because it attracts the forces of the FATHER, much loved, of the SON much adored and of the HOLY SPIRIT very wise. The vowel A attracts the forces of the FATHER, the vowel U attracts the forces of the SON, the vowel M attracts the forces of the HOLY SPIRIT. AUM is a powerful LOGICAL MANTRAM.

The devotee must chant this powerful MANTRAM four times during this practice of ARIES and then standing up facing east he will extend his right arm forward moving his head seven times forward, seven backward, seven circling on the right side, seven circling on the left side with the intention that the light of ARIES works inside the brain awakening the pineal and pituitary glands that allow us the perception of the SUPERIOR DIMENSIONS OF SPACE.

It is urgent that the LIGHT OF ARIES develops within our brain awakening CONSCIOUSNESS, developing the secret powers contained in the PITUITARY and PINEAL GLANDS.

ARIES is the symbol of RA, RAMA, the lamb. The powerful MANTRAM RA, chanting it as it should be, makes the spinal fires and the seven magnetic centres of the spine vibrate.

ARIES is a zodiac sign of fire, possesses a formidable energy and the MICRO-COSMOS MAN captures it according to his own way of thinking, feeling and acting.

HITLER, who was a native of ARIES, used this type of energy in a destructive way, however, we must recognise that in principle, before committing the madness of launching humanity into the Second World War, he used the energy of ARIES in a constructive way, raising the standard of living of the GERMAN PEOPLE.

We have been able to verify through direct experience that natives of ARIES argue a lot with their spouse.

Natives of ARIES have a marked tendency to quarrel, they are very quarrelsome by nature.

Natives of ARIES feel capable of embarking on great enterprises and bringing them to fruition.

There is in the natives of ARIES the serious defect of always wanting to use the force of will in a selfish, HITLER-style, ANTISOCIAL and destructive way.

Natives of ARIES like independent life very much, but many ARIANS prefer the military and in this there is no independence.

In the character of ARIANS prevail pride, self-confidence, ambition and a truly crazy courage.

The metal of ARIES is IRON, stone, RUBY, colour, RED, element, FIRE.

Marriage with people from LIBRA is suitable for natives of ARIES, because fire and air understand each other very well.

If natives of ARIES want to be happy in marriage, they must end the defect of anger.
