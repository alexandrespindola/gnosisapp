FROM 20 FEBRUARY TO 21 MARCH

We have arrived at the MOTHER-NIGHT of Egyptian Cosmology, the deep ocean of PISCES, the INITIATIC boundless darkness of ABSOLUTE ABSTRACT space; the first element of the abyss where the undines guard the GOLD of the RHINE or FIRE of DIVINE and GENESIAC THOUGHT.

PISCES is wisely symbolised by two FISH; the fish, the Fish, is the SOMA of the MYSTERIES OF ISIS. THE FISH IS THE LIVING SYMBOL OF EARLY GNOSTIC CHRISTIANITY.

The TWO FISH of PISCES linked by a hyphen have a profound GNOSTIC meaning, they represent the two SOULS of the PRIMORDIAL ELOHIM submerged among the deep waters of the MOTHER-NIGHT.

We have already explained in previous chapters that the INNER, the BEING, ATMAN, has two SOULS: one FEMALE, the other MALE.

We have already explained that the SPIRITUAL SOUL, BUDDHI, is female. We have already said, and we repeat it, that the HUMAN SOUL, superior MANAS, is male.

The sacred couple, the DIVINE ETERNAL MARRIAGE, is always symbolised by two fish linked by a hyphen; the latter is the BEING ATMAN.

The sacred couple, the two eternal FISH, work among the waters of the abyss when the dawn of the MAHANVANTARA arrives.

The two ineffable FISH work under the direction of ATMAN, when the hour of the dawn of creation arrives.

However, it is good to remember that ISIS and OSIRIS could never work in the GREAT WORK, without the famous MERCURY of SECRET PHILOSOPHY. In this SEXUAL MERCURY is found the key to all power.

A circle with a vertical line through it, hieratic symbolism, is the most sacred union of the ETERNAL FEMININE with the ETERNAL MASCULINE; the INTEGRATION of the opposites in the ESSENTIAL, ineffable and Divine MONAD.

From the GREAT MOTHER-SPACE emerges the Monad, the BEING. From the GREAT OCEAN the ELOHIM rise up to work in the dawn of the MAHANVANTARA.

WATER is the feminine element of all creation, from which comes the MATER LATINA, and the letter M, terribly DIVINE.

In GNOSTIC CHRISTIANITY, MARY is the same ISIS, the MOTHER OF THE COSMOS, the eternal MOTHER-SPACE, the deep waters of the abyss.

The word MARY is divided into two syllables; the first is MAR, which reminds us of the deep ocean of PISCES. The second is IA, which is a variant of IO (iiioooo), the august name of the MOTHER-SPACE, the circle of NOTHINGNESS, from where everything emanates and to where everything returns; the ONE, the UNIQUE ONE of the manifested universe, after the night of the great Pralaya or annihilation.

The upper Waters being separated from the lower, light was made, that is, the animating WORD of the COSMOS, the SON, came to life, and this life took as its transmitting element the SUN, which is found in the centre of our solar system, like the heart within our organism.

The fertile Vibrations of the SUN are really the living ELEMENTAL FIRE that is condensed in the centre of each planet, constituting the heart of each of these.

All that LIGHT, all that LIFE, is represented by the seven spirits before the throne, within the HEART-TEMPLE of each of the seven planets of the SOLAR SYSTEM.

The work of separating the waters from the waters corresponds to the sacred couple. Each of the SEVEN SPIRITS before the THRONE, emanated from ITSELF, the sacred couple of FISH so that they could work in the DAWN of creation with the power of KRIYASAKTY, the power of the lost word, the power of the WILL and YOGA.

The LOVE of LOVES, the MYSTICAL PASSION of the last fire between the ETERNAL SPOUSE and the DIVINE WIFE, are vital to separate the UPPER WATERS from the LOWER WATERS.

In this WORK there is TRANSCENDENTAL MAITHUNA; KRIYASAKTY, CREATING WORD.

He contributes the FIRE and she transmutes the waters, separating the UPPER from the LOWER.

The two Fish then project that fire and that transmuted upper water onto the waters of CHAOS, onto the cosmic or material matter for worlds, onto the dormant germs of existence, and life springs forth.

All the work is done with the help of the WORD and of the WILL and YOGA.

In principle, the UNIVERSE is subtle, then it condenses materially, passing through successive periods of progressive CRYSTALLISATION.

There are millions of UNIVERSES in infinite space, within the bosom of MOTHER-SPACE.

Some UNIVERSES are emerging from PRALAYA, springing from among the deep waters of PISCES, others are in full activity, others are dissolving among the eternal waters.

ISIS and OSIRIS could do nothing without the SEXUAL MERCURY, the two eternal fish love each other, adore each other and live always creating and creating again.

The fish is the most sacred symbol of EARLY CHRISTIAN GNOSTICISM. It is a pity that thousands of occultism students have forgotten the GNOSIS of the fish.

On our planet Earth live seven HUMANITIES with physical bodies and of all seven, the last is ours, the only one that has failed because it has lost the GNOSIS.

The other six HUMANITIES live in a JINAS state, in the FOURTH DIMENSION, either within the interior of the EARTH, or in many JINAS regions and areas.

The AGE of PISCES should not have been a failure as it really was. The causa causorum of the PISCEAN failure was due to certain dark elements that betrayed the GNOSIS and preached certain AGNOSTIC or ANTI-GNOSTIC DOCTRINES, underestimating the FISH, rejecting the WISDOM RELIGION and plunging humanity into materialism.

Let us remember LUCIUS arriving in the city of HYPATIA, later lodging in the house of MILON, whose wife PAMPHILA is a perverse sorceress. LUCIUS goes out shortly afterwards to buy fish (THE ICTUS, SYMBOL OF NASCENT GNOSTIC CHRISTIANITY, THE FISH, FISH, SOMA, of the MYSTERIES OF ISIS).

The fishermen sell it to him for an unhappy twenty denarii and with a certain terrible disdain, what they previously intended to sell for a hundred shields, a terrible satire in which the greatest contempt is enveloped for the NASCENT and already infatuated GNOSTIC CHRISTIANITY.

The result of AGNOSTIC or ANTI-GNOSTIC CHRISTIANITY was MARXIST MATERIALIST DIALECTICS.

The REACTION against GNOSTICISM was repugnant MATERIALISM without GOD and without law.

It can be assured that the age of PISCES failed because of AGNOSTICISM. The betrayal of the GNOSIS was the most serious crime of the age of PISCES.

JESUS ​​the CHRIST and his twelve fishermen, INITIATED an age that could well have been of great splendour.

JESUS ​​and his TWELVE GNOSTIC APOSTLES indicated the precise path for the age of PISCES, GNOSTICISM, the wisdom of the FISH.

It is regrettable that all the sacred books of the HOLY GNOSIS were burned and that the sacred symbol of the fish was forgotten.

PRACTICE. During the sign of PISCES it is necessary to vocalise one hour daily. Let us remember that in the beginning was the WORD and that the WORD was with GOD and that the WORD was GOD.

In ancient times the seven vowels of nature resonated throughout the human organism from head to toe, and now it is necessary to restore the seven notes on the marvellous harp of our organism, to restore the lost powers.

The vowel "I" makes the PINEAL and PITUITARY glands vibrate; these two little glands of the head are joined by an extremely subtle channel or capillary, already disappeared in corpses.

The PINEAL is found in the upper part of the brain and the pituitary in the cavernous plexus between the eyebrows.

Each of these two little glands has its VITAL AURA and when the two AURAS mix, the SPATIAL SENSE develops and we see the ULTRA of all things.

The vowel "E" makes the thyroid gland vibrate, which secretes BIOLOGICAL IODINE. This Gland is found in the throat and in it resides the chakra of the magic ear.

The vowel "O" makes the HEART CHAKRA vibrate, the centre of INTUITION, and all kinds of powers to go out in ASTRAL, JINAS state, etc.

The vowel "U" makes the SOLAR PLEXUS vibrate, located in the navel region. This SOLAR PLEXUS is the Telepathic Centre and the emotional Brain.

The vowel "A" makes the pulmonary chakras vibrate, which allow us to remember our past lives.

The vowel "M", profoundly held as a consonant, is vocalised with the lips closed, without opening the mouth, the sound that then comes out through the nose is the "M".

The vowel "M" makes the ENS SEMINIS vibrate, the waters of life, the MERCURY of secret philosophy.

The vowel "S" is a sweet and gentle whistle that makes the fire within us vibrate.

Sitting in a comfortable armchair, you have to vocalise I. E. 0. U. A. M. S. Carrying the sound of each of these seven vowels from head to toe.

It is necessary to inhale, then exhaling the air together with the well-prolonged vocal sound, until the exhalation is exhausted.

This practice must be done daily to develop the Eternal magical powers.

PISCES is governed by NEPTUNE, the planet of practical occultism, and by JUPITER the THUNDERING, the Father of the GODS.

The metal of Pisces is the TIN of Jupiter; stones, AMETHYST, CORALS. Pisces governs the FEET.

Natives of Pisces usually have two wives, several children. They are dual in nature and have a disposition for two professions or trades. Natives of Pisces are very difficult to understand, they live like the fish, in everything, but separated from everything by the liquid element. They adapt to everything, but deep down they despise all the things of the world. They are exquisitely sensitive, intuitive, profound and people cannot understand them.

Natives of Pisces have a great disposition for occultism, because Pisces is governed by NEPTUNE, the planet of ESOTERISM.

PISCES women are very nervous, sensitive as a delicate flower; intuitive, impressionable.

Pisceans have good social feelings, cheerful, peaceful, hospitable by nature.

The danger of Pisceans is falling into laziness, negligence, passivity and indifference to life.

Pisceans can even reach a lack of moral responsibility. The mind of Pisceans oscillates between quick or fatal understanding, laziness and contempt for the things most necessary for life. They are two extremes and as soon as they fall into one extreme as into the other. The will of Pisceans is sometimes strong, but changeable on other occasions.

When Pisceans fall into indifference and extreme passivity, they let themselves be carried away by the current of the river of life, but when they see the seriousness of their conduct, they put their will of steel into play and then radically change the entire course of their existence.

Pisceans of the superior type are GNOSTIC one hundred percent, possess an unshakeable will of steel and a very high sense of moral responsibility.

The superior type of PISCES gives great ILLUMINATED, MASTERS, AVATARS, KINGS, INITIATES, etc., etc.

The inferior type of PISCES has a marked tendency towards LUST, alcoholism, gluttony, laziness, pride.

Pisceans like to travel, but not all can travel. Pisceans have great imagination and tremendous sensitivity.

It is very difficult to understand PISCEANS, only PISCEANS can understand Pisceans.

Everything that for ordinary people is of great importance, for Pisceans is worth nothing, but he is diplomatic, he adapts to people, he pretends that he agrees with them.

The most serious thing for natives of Pisces is having to define themselves in the conjugal question, because almost always two basic fundamental loves put them in a dead end.

The SUPERIOR type of PISCES already transcends these weaknesses and is ABSOLUTELY CHASTE.

Usually Pisceans suffer a lot with the family in their early years.

It is difficult to find a Piscean who has been happy with the family during their early years.

The very inferior type of PISCES women falls into prostitution and alcoholism.

The superior type of PISCES women never falls like that, she is like a very delicate flower, like a beautiful LOTUS flower.
