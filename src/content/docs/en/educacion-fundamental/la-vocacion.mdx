With the exception of those who are completely incapacitated, every human being has to be useful for something in life; the difficult part is knowing what each individual is useful for.

If there is anything truly important in this world, it is knowing ourselves. It is rare for someone to know themselves, and even though it may seem incredible, it is difficult to find someone in life who has developed a sense of vocation.

When someone is fully convinced of the role they have to play in existence, they then make their vocation an apostolate, a religion, and become, in fact and by right, an apostle of humanity.

Whoever knows their vocation or discovers it for themselves undergoes a tremendous change. They no longer seek success; they care little for money, fame, or gratitude. Their pleasure then lies in the joy that comes from having responded to an intimate, profound, unknown call from their own inner essence.

The most interesting thing about all of this is that the vocational sense has nothing to do with the ego. Strange as it may seem, the ego loathes our own vocation because it only desires juicy monetary gains, position, fame, etc.

The sense of vocation is something that belongs to our own inner essence; it is something very internal, very profound, very intimate.

The vocational sense leads people to undertake the most tremendous enterprises with true courage and genuine selflessness, at the cost of all kinds of suffering and ordeals. It is therefore perfectly normal for the ego to loathe true vocation.

The sense of vocation leads us, in fact, along the path of legitimate heroism, even when we have to stoically endure all kinds of infamy, betrayal, and slander.

The day a person can truthfully say, "I know who I am and what my true vocation is," from that moment on they will begin to live with true rectitude and love. Such a person lives in their work and their work in them.

In truth, very few people can speak like this, with true sincerity of heart. Those who speak in this way are the select few who possess the sense of vocation to a superlative degree.

Finding our true vocation is, without a doubt, the most serious social problem, the problem that lies at the very foundation of all societal problems.

Finding or discovering our true individual vocation is, in fact, equivalent to discovering a very precious treasure.

When a citizen finds their true and legitimate occupation with complete certainty and without a doubt, they become irreplaceable by that very fact.

When our vocation corresponds fully and absolutely to the position we hold in life, we then perform our work as a true apostolate, without any greed or desire for power.

Then, instead of producing greed, boredom, or a desire to change jobs, work brings us true, deep, intimate joy, even when we have to patiently endure painful ordeals.

In practice, we have been able to verify that when the position does not correspond to the individual's vocation, they only think in terms of more.

The ego's mechanism is more: more money, more fame, more projects, etc., etc., etc., and, as is only natural, the subject tends to become hypocritical, exploitative, cruel, ruthless, uncompromising, etc.

If we study the bureaucracy carefully, we can see that rarely in life does the position correspond to the individual's vocation.

If we study the various guilds of the proletariat in detail, we can see that only very rarely does the occupation correspond to the individual's vocation.

When we carefully observe the privileged classes, whether they are from the East or the West of the world, we can see a total lack of vocational sense. So-called "well-off kids" now commit armed robbery, rape defenseless women, etc., to kill boredom. Having not found their place in life, they are disoriented and become rebels without a cause, just to "change things up a bit".

The chaotic state of humanity in these times of global crisis is appalling.

No one is happy with their job because the position does not correspond to their vocation. Job applications are pouring in because no one wants to starve, but the applications do not correspond to the vocation of those who are applying.

Many drivers should be doctors or engineers. Many lawyers should be ministers, and many ministers should be tailors. Many shoe cleaners should be ministers, and many ministers should be shoe cleaners, etc., etc.

People are in positions that do not correspond to them, that have nothing to do with their true individual vocation. As a result, the social machine functions terribly. This is like an engine built with parts that do not belong to it, and the result has to be inevitably disaster, failure, absurdity.

In practice, we have been able to verify to satiety that when someone does not have the vocational disposition to be a guide, religious instructor, political leader, or director of some spiritualist, scientific, literary, philanthropic association, etc., they only think in terms of more and dedicate themselves to making project after project with secret, unconfessable purposes.

It is obvious that when the position does not correspond to the individual's vocation, the result is exploitation.

In these terribly materialistic times in which we live, the position of teacher is being arbitrarily occupied by many merchants who do not remotely have a vocation for teaching. The result of such infamy is exploitation, cruelty, and a lack of true love.

Many subjects practice teaching exclusively for the purpose of getting money to pay for their studies in the Faculty of Medicine, Law, or Engineering, or simply because they can't find anything else to do. The victims of such intellectual fraud are the students.

The true vocational teacher is very difficult to find today and is the greatest joy that students in schools, colleges, and universities can have.

The vocation of the teacher is wisely translated by that piece of moving prose by Gabriela Mistral titled The Teacher's Prayer. The provincial teacher says, addressing the Divine to the Secret Master:

"Give me the unique love of my school: may not even the burning of beauty be able to rob it of my tenderness at every moment. Master, make my fervor enduring and my disenchantment fleeting. Tear from me this impure desire for misunderstood justice that still disturbs me, the petty insinuation of protest that rises from me when I am hurt, may I not be pained by the incomprehension nor saddened by the oblivion of those I taught."

"Give me the being more mother than mothers, to be able to love and defend as they do what is not flesh of my flesh. Allow me to make one of my girls my perfect verse and to leave in her my most penetrating melody, for when my lips sing no more."

"Show me your Gospel possible in my time, so that I do not renounce the battle of each day and of each hour for it."

Who can measure the wonderful psychic influence of a teacher so inspired with such tenderness by the sense of their vocation?

An individual discovers their vocation in one of three ways: first: the self-discovery of a special ability. Second: the vision of an urgent need. Third: the very rare direction of parents and teachers who discovered the student's vocation by observing their aptitudes.

Many individuals have discovered their vocation at a particular critical moment in their lives, in the face of a serious situation that demanded immediate remedy.

Gandhi was just any lawyer when, because of an attack on the rights of Hindus in South Africa, he cancelled his return ticket to India and stayed to defend the cause of his compatriots. A momentary need led him to the vocation of his whole life.

The great benefactors of humanity have found their vocation in the face of a situational crisis that demanded immediate remedy. Let us remember Oliver Cromwell, the father of English liberties; Benito Juárez, the forger of the new Mexico; José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar, fathers of South American independence, etc., etc.

Jesus, the Christ, Buddha, Muhammad, Hermes, Zoroaster, Confucius, Fuhi, etc., were men who at a certain moment in history knew how to understand their true vocation and felt called by the inner voice that emanates from the intimate.

Fundamental education is called upon to discover the latent capacity of students by various methods. The methods that outdated pedagogy is using these days to discover the vocation of students are, without a doubt, cruel, absurd, and ruthless.

Vocational questionnaires have been developed by merchants who arbitrarily occupy the position of teachers.

In some countries, before entering preparatory and vocational schools, students are subjected to the most horrible psychological cruelties. They are asked questions about mathematics, civics, biology, etc.

The cruelest of these methods are the famous psychological tests, I.Q. index, intimately related to mental promptness.

Depending on the type of response, depending on how they are qualified, the student is then bottled in one of the three high school tracks. First: Physical-Mathematical. Second: Biological Sciences. Third: Social Sciences.

Engineers, architects, astronomers, aviators, etc., come from the Physical-Mathematical track.

Pharmacists, nurses, biologists, doctors, etc., come from the Biological Sciences track.

Lawyers, writers, doctors in philosophy and letters, business managers, etc., come from the Social Sciences track.

The curriculum in each country is different, and it is clear that not all countries have three different high school tracks. In many countries, there is only one high school track, and after finishing it, the student goes to university.

In some nations, the student's vocational capacity is not examined, and they enter the faculty with the desire to have a profession to earn a living, even if it does not coincide with their innate tendencies, with their vocational sense.

There are countries where the vocational capacity of students is examined, and there are nations where they are not examined. It is absurd not to know how to guide students vocationally, not to examine their innate capacities and tendencies. Vocational questionnaires and all that jargon of questions, psychological tests, I.Q. index, etc., are stupid.

Those methods of vocational examination are useless because the mind has its moments of crisis, and if the examination is verified in one of those moments, the result is the failure and disorientation of the student.

Teachers have been able to verify that the minds of students have, like the sea, their high and low tides, their plus and their minus. There is a bio-rhythm in the male and female glands. There is also a bio-rhythm for the mind.

At certain times, the male glands are in plus and the female glands in minus, or vice versa. The mind also has its plus and its minus.

Whoever wants to know the science of bio-rhythm, we suggest they study the famous work titled Bio-rhythm written by the eminent Gnostic Rosicrucian sage, Doctor Arnoldo Krumm Heller, medical colonel of the Mexican Army and professor of medicine at the Faculty of Berlin.

We emphatically affirm that an emotional crisis or a state of psychic nervousness in the face of the difficult situation of an examination can lead a student to failure during the pre-vocational examination.

We affirm that any abuse of the center of movement caused perhaps by sport, by an excessive walk, or by arduous physical work, etc., can originate intellectual crisis even when the mind is in plus and lead the student to failure during a pre-vocational examination.

We affirm that any crisis related to the instinctive center, perhaps in combination with sexual pleasure, or with the emotional center, etc., can lead the student to failure during a pre-vocational examination.

We affirm that any sexual crisis, a syncope of repressed sexuality, sexual abuse, etc., can exert its disastrous influence on the mind, leading it to failure during a pre-vocational examination.

Fundamental education teaches that vocational germs are deposited not only in the intellectual center but also in each of the other four centers of the psychophysiology of the organic machine.

It is urgent to take into account the five psychic centers called Intellect, Emotion, Movement, Instinct, and Sex. It is absurd to think that the intellect is the only center of cognition. If the intellectual center is examined exclusively for the purpose of discovering the vocational attitudes of a particular subject, in addition to committing a serious injustice that is in fact very harmful to the individual and to society, an error is incurred because the germs of the vocation are not only contained in the intellectual center but also, in each of the other four psycho-psychological centers of the individual.

The only obvious path that exists to discover the true vocation of students is true love.

If parents and teachers associate in mutual agreement to investigate in the home and in the school, to observe in detail all the acts of the students, they could discover the innate tendencies of each student.

That is the only obvious path that will allow parents and teachers to discover the vocational sense of the students.

This requires true love from parents and teachers, and it is obvious that if there is no true love from parents and authentic vocational teachers capable of truly sacrificing themselves for their disciples, such an enterprise is then impracticable.

If governments truly want to save society, they need to expel the merchants from the temple with the whip of the will.

A new cultural era must begin by spreading the doctrine of fundamental education everywhere.

Students must defend their rights courageously and demand true vocational teachers from governments. Fortunately, the formidable weapon of strikes exists, and the students have that weapon.

In some countries, there are already within schools, colleges, and universities certain guiding teachers who are not really vocational; the position they occupy does not coincide with their innate tendencies. These teachers cannot guide others because they could not guide themselves.

True vocational teachers capable of intelligently guiding students are urgently needed.

It is necessary to know that due to the plurality of the ego, the human being automatically represents various roles in the theatre of life. Boys and girls have one role for school, another for the street, and another for the home.

If you want to discover the vocation of a young man or a young woman, you have to observe them at school, at home, and even on the street.

This work of observation can only be carried out by true parents and teachers in intimate association.

Among antiquated pedagogy there is also the system of observing grades to deduce vocations. The student who distinguished himself in civics with the highest grades is then classified as a possible lawyer, and the one who distinguished himself in biology is defined as a potential doctor, and the one who distinguished himself in mathematics, as a possible engineer, etc.

This absurd system for deducing vocations is too empirical because the mind has its highs and its lows not only in the total way already known but also in certain special particular states.

Many writers who were terrible grammar students at school excelled in life as true masters of language. Many notable engineers always had the worst grades in mathematics at school, and many doctors were failed in biology and natural sciences at school.

It is regrettable that many parents, instead of studying the aptitudes of their children, only see in them the continuation of their beloved ego, psychological ego, myself.

Many lawyer parents want their children to continue in the office, and many business owners want their children to continue managing their selfish interests, without being interested in the least in their vocational sense.

The ego always wants to climb, climb to the top of the ladder, make itself felt, and when its ambitions fail, then they want to achieve through their children what they could not achieve by themselves. These ambitious parents put their boys and girls in careers and positions that have nothing to do with their vocational sense.
