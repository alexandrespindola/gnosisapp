With the exception of those who are completely disabled, every human being has to be useful for something in life, the difficult part is knowing what each individual is good for.

If there is anything truly important in this world, it is knowing ourselves, rare is the one who knows himself and even when it seems incredible, it is difficult to find in life someone who has developed a sense of vocation.

When someone is fully convinced of the role they have to play in existence, they then make their vocation an apostolate, a religion, and become in fact and by their own right an apostle of humanity.

Whoever knows their vocation or who discovers it for themselves, goes through a tremendous change, no longer seeks success, is little interested in money, fame, gratitude, their pleasure is then in the joy provided by having responded to an intimate, deep, unknown call of their own inner essence.

The most interesting thing about all this is that the VOCATIONAL sense has nothing to do with the EGO, because although it seems strange the EGO hates our own vocation because the EGO only craves juicy monetary incomes, position, fame, etc.

The sense of VOCATION is something that belongs to our own INNER ESSENCE; it is something very inside, very deep, very intimate.

The vocational sense leads man to undertake with true courage and genuine disinterest the most tremendous enterprises at the cost of all kinds of sufferings and calvaries. It is therefore only normal that the EGO hates the true vocation.

The sense of VOCATION leads us in fact along the path of legitimate heroism, even when we have to stoically endure all kinds of infamies, betrayals and slanders.

The day a man can tell the truth "I KNOW WHO I AM AND WHAT IS MY TRUE VOCATION" from that moment on he will begin to live with true righteousness and love. Such a man lives in his work and his work in him.

Really only very few men can speak like this, with true sincerity of heart. Those who speak like this are the select ones who have in superlative degree the sense of VOCATION.

FINDING our true VOCATION IS WITHOUT A DOUBT, the most serious social problem, the problem that lies at the very base of all the problems of society.

Finding or discovering our true individual vocation, is in fact equivalent to discovering a very precious treasure.

When a citizen finds with all certainty and beyond any doubt his true and legitimate occupation, he becomes by this very fact IRREPLACEABLE.

When our vocation corresponds completely and absolutely to the position we are occupying in life, we then exercise our work as a true apostolate, without any greed and without desire for power.

Then the work instead of producing greed, boredom or desires to change jobs, brings us true, deep, intimate joy even when we have to patiently endure painful Stations of the Cross.

In practice we have been able to verify that when the position does not correspond to the VOCATION of the individual, then he only thinks in terms of MORE.

The mechanism of the EGO is MORE. More money, more fame, more projects, etc. etc. etc. and as is only natural the subject usually becomes hypocritical, exploitative, cruel, ruthless, uncompromising, etc.

If we study the bureaucracy carefully we can verify that rarely in life the position corresponds to the individual vocation.

If we study in a detailed way the different guilds of the proletariat, we can show that in very rare occasions the occupation corresponds to the individual VOCATION.

When we carefully observe the privileged classes, whether they are from the east or the west of the world, we can see the total lack of VOCATIONAL sense. The so-called "WELL-OFF KIDS" now assault with weapons, rape defenseless women, etc. to kill boredom. Having not found their place in life, they are disoriented and become REBELS WITHOUT A CAUSE as to "vary a little".

The chaotic state of humanity is appalling in these times of global crisis.

No one is happy with their work because the position does not correspond to the vocation, job applications are pouring in because no one wants to starve to death, but the applications do not correspond to the VOCATION of those who apply.

Many drivers should be doctors or engineers. Many lawyers should be ministers and many ministers should be tailors. Many shoe shiners should be ministers and many ministers should be shoe shiners, etc. etc.

People are in positions that do not correspond to them, that have nothing to do with their true individual VOCATION, because of this the social machine works very badly. This is similar to an engine that was structured with parts that do not correspond to it and the result has to be inevitably disaster, failure, absurdity.

In practice we have been able to verify ad nauseam that when someone does not have VOCATIONAL disposition to be a guide, religious instructor, political leader or director of any spiritualist, scientific, literary, philanthropic association, etc. then he only thinks in terms of MORE and dedicates himself to make projects and more projects with secret unconfessable purposes.

It is obvious that when the position does not correspond to the individual VOCATION the result is exploitation.

In these terribly materialistic times in which we live, the position of teacher is being arbitrarily occupied by many merchants who do not even remotely have VOCATION for Teaching. The result of such infamy is exploitation, cruelty and lack of true love.

Many subjects exercise teaching exclusively for the purpose of getting money to pay for their studies in the Faculty of Medicine, Law or Engineering or simply because they can not find anything else to do. The victims of such intellectual fraud are the students.

The true vocational teacher today is very difficult to find and is the greatest joy that students of schools, colleges and universities can have.

The VOCATION of the teacher is wisely translated by that piece of moving prose by GABRIELA MÍSTRAL entitled the TEACHER'S PRAYER. Says the provincial teacher addressing the DIVINE to the SECRET TEACHER:

"Give me the unique love, of my school: that not even the burning of beauty be capable of stealing from it my tenderness of all moments. Teacher, make the fervor lasting for me and the disappointment fleeting. Tear from me this impure desire for misunderstood justice that still disturbs me, the petty insinuation of protest that rises from me when I am hurt, may the misunderstanding not hurt me or the oblivion of those I taught sadden me".

"Give me to be more mother than mothers, to be able to love and defend as they do what is NOT flesh of my flesh. Give me the reach to make one of my girls my perfect verse and to leave in her nailed my most penetrating melody, for when my lips sing no more".

"Show me possible your Gospel in my time, so that I do not give up the battle of each day and of each hour for it."

Who can measure the wonderful psychic influence of such a teacher inspired with so much tenderness, by the sense of his VOCATION?

The individual finds his vocation by one of these three ways: first: SELF-DISCOVERY of a special ability. Second: the vision of an urgent need. Third: the very rare direction of parents and teachers who discovered the VOCATION of the student by observing his abilities.

Many individuals have discovered their VOCATION at a certain critical moment in their lives, in the face of a serious situation that demanded immediate remedy.

GANDHI was any lawyer, when on the occasion of an attack against the rights of Hindus in SOUTH Africa he canceled his return ticket to India and stayed to defend the cause of his compatriots. A momentary need led him towards the VOCATION of his whole life.

The great benefactors of humanity, have found their VOCATION before a situational crisis, which demanded immediate remedy. Let us remember OLIVER CROMWELL, the father of English liberties; Benito Juárez, the forger of the new Mexico; José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar, fathers of South American independence, etc., etc.

JESUS, the CHRIST, BUDDHA, MUHAMMAD, HERMES, ZOROASTER, CONFUCIUS, FUHI, etc., were men who at a certain moment in history knew how to understand their true VOCATION and felt called by the inner voice that emanates from the INTIMATE.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is called to discover by various methods, the latent capacity of students. The methods that extemporaneous pedagogy is using these days to discover the VOCATION of the students, are without a doubt cruel, absurd and ruthless.

The VOCATIONAL questionnaires have been elaborated by merchants who arbitrarily occupy the position of teachers.

In some countries before entering preparatory and VOCATIONAL schools, students are subjected to the most horrible psychological cruelties. They are asked questions about mathematics, civics, biology, etc.

The most cruel of these methods are the famous psychological TESTS, I.Q. index, intimately related to mental promptness.

Depending on the type of answer, depending on how they are rated, the student is then bottled in one of the three bachelors. First: Physical Mathematicians. Second: Biological Sciences. Third: Social Sciences.

From the Physical Mathematicians come engineers. Architects, Astronomers, Aviators, etc.

From the Biological Sciences come Pharmacists, Nurses, Biologists, Doctors, etc.

From the Social Sciences come Lawyers, Writers, Doctors in Philosophy and Letters, Directors of Companies, etc.

The curriculum in each country is different and it is clear that not in all countries there are three different bachelors. In many countries there is only one bachelor and after finishing it the student goes to the University.

In some nations the VOCATIONAL capacity of the student is not examined and he enters the faculty with the desire to have a profession to earn a living, even when it does not coincide with his innate tendencies, with his VOCATIONAL sense.

There are countries where the VOCATIONAL capacity of the students is examined and there are nations where they are not examined. It is absurd not to know how to guide VOCATIONALLY the students, not to examine their capacities and innate tendencies. Stupid are the VOCATIONAL questionnaires and all that jargon of questions, PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS, I.Q. index, etc.

Those methods of VOCATIONAL examination are useless because the mind has its moments of crisis and if the examination is verified in one of those moments, the result is the failure and disorientation of the student.

The teachers have been able to verify that the mind of the students has, like the sea, its high and low tides, its plus and its minus. There is a Bio-Rhythm in the male and female glands. There is also a Bio-Rhythm for the mind.

In certain times the masculine glands are in PLUS and the feminine ones in MINUS or vice versa. The mind also has its PLUS and its MINUS.

Whoever wants to know the science of BIO RHYTHM we indicate to study the famous work entitled BIO RHYTHM written by the eminent GNÓSTIC ROSA-CRUZ scholar, Doctor Amoldo Krumm Heller, Medical colonel of the Mexican Army and Professor of Medicine of the Faculty of Berlin.

We emphatically affirm that an emotional crisis or a state of psychic nervousness before the difficult situation of an examination can lead a student to failure during the pre-vocational examination.

We affirm that any abuse of the center of movement produced perhaps by the sport, by an excessive walk, or by a hard physical work, etc. can cause INTELLECTUAL crisis even when the mind is in PLUS and lead the student to failure during a prevocational examination.

We affirm that any crisis related to the instinctive center, perhaps in combination with sexual pleasure, or with the emotional center, etc., can lead the student to failure during a pre-vocational examination.

We affirm that any sexual crisis, a syncope of repressed sexuality, a sexual abuse, etc., can exert its disastrous influence on the mind leading it to failure during a pre-vocational examination.

Fundamental education teaches that vocational germs are deposited, not only in the intellectual center but also in each of the other four centers of the Psychophysiology of the organic machine.

It is urgent to take into account the five psychic centers called Intellect, Emotion, Movement, Instinct and Sex. It is absurd to think that the intellect is the only center of Cognition. If the intellectual center is examined exclusively with the purpose of discovering the vocational attitudes of a certain subject, in addition to committing a serious injustice that results in fact very harmful to the individual and to society, an error is incurred because the germs of the vocation are not only contained in the intellectual center but also, in each of the other four Psycho-Psychological centers of the individual.

The only obvious way that exists to discover the true vocation of the students is the TRUE LOVE.

If parents and teachers associate in mutual agreement to investigate in the home and in the school, to observe in detail all the acts of the students, could discover the innate tendencies of each student.

That is the only obvious way that will allow parents and teachers to discover the vocational sense of the students.

This requires true LOVE of parents and teachers and it is obvious that if there is no true love of parents and mothers and authentic vocational teachers capable of truly sacrificing themselves for their disciples, such enterprise is then impracticable.

If governments really want to save society, they need to expel the merchants from the temple with the whip of the will.

A new cultural era should be initiated by spreading everywhere the doctrine of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

Students must defend their rights courageously and demand true vocational teachers from governments. Fortunately there is the formidable weapon of strikes and students have that weapon.

In some countries there are already within schools, colleges and universities, certain guiding teachers who are not really vocational, the position they occupy does not coincide with their innate tendencies. These teachers cannot guide others because they could not guide themselves either.

True vocational teachers capable of intelligently guiding the students are urgently needed.

It is necessary to know that due to the plurality of the EGO, the human being automatically represents diverse roles in the theater of life. Boys and girls have a role for school, another for the street and another for home.

If you want to discover the VOCATION of a young man or a young woman you have to observe them at school, at home and even in the street.

This work of observation can only be done by true parents and teachers in intimate association.

Among the outdated pedagogy there is also the system of observing grades to deduce vocations. The student who distinguished himself in civics with the highest grades is then classified as a possible lawyer and the one who distinguished himself in biology is defined as a potential doctor, and the one who in mathematics, as a possible engineer, etc.

This absurd system for deducing VOCATIONS is too empirical because the mind has its ups and downs not only in the total way already known but also in certain special particular states.

Many writers who in school were terrible students of grammar excelled in life as true masters of language. Many notable engineers always had in school the worst grades in Mathematics and a multitude of doctors were in school failed in biology and natural sciences.

It is regrettable that many parents instead of studying the aptitudes of their children only see in them the continuation of their beloved EGO, psychological EGO, MYSELF.

Many lawyer parents want their children to continue in the firm and many business owners want their children to continue managing their selfish interests without interesting them in the slightest the vocational sense of them.

The EGO always wants to climb, climb to the top of the ladder, make itself felt and when its ambitions fail then they want to achieve through their children what they could not achieve by themselves. These ambitious parents put their boys and girls in careers and positions that have nothing to do with the VOCATIONAL sense of these.
