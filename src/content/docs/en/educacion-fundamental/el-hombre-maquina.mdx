THE MACHINE-MAN is the unhappiest beast that exists in this vale of tears, yet he has the PRETENSION and even the INSOLENCE to STYLE HIMSELF KING OF NATURE.

"KNOW THYSELF" "MAN, KNOW THYSELF". This is an ancient GOLDEN MAXIM written on the unconquered walls of the temple of Delphi in ANCIENT GREECE.

Man, that poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL who mistakenly calls himself MAN, has invented thousands of highly complicated and difficult machines and knows full well that in order to make use of a MACHINE, he sometimes needs many years of study and learning, but when it comes to HIMSELF, he completely forgets this fact, even though he himself is a more complicated machine than all those he has invented.

There is no man who is not full of totally false ideas about himself, the most serious thing is that he does not want to realise that he really is a machine.

The human machine has no freedom of movement, it functions only by multiple and varied internal influences and external shocks.

All the movements, acts, words, ideas, emotions, feelings, desires, of the human machine are provoked by external influences and by multiple strange and difficult internal causes.

THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is a poor talking puppet with memory and vitality, a living doll, who has the foolish illusion that he can DO, when in reality he can do nothing at all.

Imagine for a moment, dear reader, an automatic mechanical doll controlled by a complex mechanism.

Imagine that this doll has life, falls in love, talks, walks, desires, makes wars, etc.

Imagine that this doll can change owners at any moment. You must imagine that each owner is a different person, has his own criteria, his own way of having fun, feeling, living, etc., etc., etc.

Any owner wanting to get money will press certain buttons and then the doll will dedicate itself to business, another owner, half an hour later or several hours later, will have a different idea and will put his doll to dance and laugh, a third will put him to fight, a fourth will make him fall in love with a woman, a fifth will make him fall in love with another, a sixth will make him fight with a neighbour and create a police problem, and a seventh will make him change his address.

Really the doll of our example has not done anything but he believes that he has done, he has the illusion that he DOES when in reality he can DO nothing because he does not have the INDIVIDUAL BEING.

Beyond any doubt, everything has happened as when it rains, when it thunders, when the sun heats up, but the poor doll believes that he DOES; he has the foolish ILLUSION that he has done everything when in reality he has done nothing, it is his respective owners who have had fun with the poor mechanical doll.

Thus is the poor intellectual animal, dear reader, a mechanical doll like the one in our illustrative example, believes that he DOES when in reality he DOES nothing, he is a puppet of flesh and blood controlled by LEGION OF SUBTLE ENERGETIC ENTITIES that together constitute what is called EGO, PLURALIZED I.

THE CHRISTIAN GOSPEL calls all those entities DEMONS and their real name is LEGION.

If we say that the I is a legion of DEMONS that control the human machine, we are not exaggerating, that is how it is.

THE MACHINE-MAN has no INDIVIDUALITY, he does not possess BEING, only the TRUE BEING has the POWER TO DO.

Only BEING can give us TRUE INDIVIDUALITY, only BEING turns us into TRUE MEN.

Whoever really wants to stop being a simple mechanical doll, must eliminate each one of those entities that together constitute the I. Each one of those ENTITIES that play with the human machine. Whoever really wants to stop being a simple mechanical doll, has to start by admitting and understanding his own mechanical nature.

He who does not want to understand or accept his own mechanical nature, he who does not want to understand this fact correctly, can no longer change, he is unhappy, unfortunate, he would be better off hanging a millstone around his neck and throwing himself to the bottom of the sea.

THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is a machine, but a very special machine, if this machine comes to understand that it is a MACHINE, if it is well driven and if circumstances allow it, it can stop being a machine and become a MAN.

First of all, it is urgent to begin by understanding deeply and on all levels of the mind, that we do not have true individuality, that we do not have a PERMANENT CENTRE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, that at a given moment we are one person and at another, another; everything depends on the ENTITY that controls the situation at any given moment.

That which originates the ILLUSION of the UNITY and INTEGRITY of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is on the one hand the sensation that his PHYSICAL BODY has, on the other hand his name and surnames and finally the memory and a certain number of mechanical habits implanted in him by EDUCATION, or acquired by simple and foolish imitation.

The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL will not be able to stop BEING A MACHINE, will not be able to change, will not be able to acquire the TRUE INDIVIDUAL BEING and become a legitimate man, as long as he does NOT have the courage to ELIMINATE THROUGH DEEP UNDERSTANDING and in successive order, each one of those METAPHYSICAL entities that together constitute what is called EGO, I, MYSELF.

Each IDEA, each PASSION, each vice, each AFFECTION, each HATE, each desire, etc., etc., etc. has its corresponding ENTITY and the set of all those ENTITIES is the PLURALIZED I of REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY.

All those METAPHYSICAL ENTITIES, all those YOES that together constitute the EGO, have no real link between them, they have no coordinates of any kind. Each one of those ENTITIES depends totally on the circumstances, change of impressions, events, etc.

THE SCREEN OF THE MIND changes colours and scenes at every moment, everything depends on the ENTITY that controls the mind at any moment.

The SCREEN of the mind is continuously passed through by the different ENTITIES that together constitute the EGO or PSYCHOLOGICAL I.

The various ENTITIES that constitute the PLURALIZED I associate, dissociate, form certain special groups according to their affinities, quarrel with each other, discuss, do not recognise each other, etc., etc., etc.

Each ENTITY of the LEGION called I, each small I, believes itself to be the whole, the TOTAL EGO, it does not even remotely suspect that it is only a tiny part.

The ENTITY that today swears eternal love to a woman, is later displaced by another ENTITY that has nothing to do with such oath and then the house of cards falls to the ground and the poor woman cries disappointed.

The ENTITY that today swears fidelity to a cause, is displaced tomorrow by another ENTITY that has nothing to do with such cause and then the subject withdraws.

The ENTITY that today swears fidelity to GNOSIS, is displaced tomorrow by another ENTITY that hates GNOSIS.

The Masters and Mistresses of Schools, Colleges and Universities, must study this book of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION and out of humanity have the courage to guide the pupils along the marvellous path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

It is necessary for the students to understand the need to know themselves in all areas of the mind.

A more efficient intellectual orientation is needed, it is necessary to understand what we are and this should begin from the very benches of the School.

We do not deny that money is needed to eat, pay the rent of the house and dress.

We do not deny that intellectual preparation, a profession, a technique is needed to earn money, but that is not everything, that is secondary.

The first, the fundamental thing is to know who we are, what we are, where we come from, where we are going, what is the object of our existence.

It is lamentable to continue as automatic dolls, miserable mortals, machine-men.

It is urgent to stop being mere machines, it is urgent to become TRUE MEN.

A radical change is needed and this must begin precisely with the ELIMINATION of each one of those ENTITIES that together constitute the PLURALIZED I.

The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is not a MAN but has within him in a latent state, all the possibilities to become a MAN.

It is NOT a law that these possibilities are developed, the most natural thing is that they are lost.

ONLY through tremendous SUPER-EFFORTS can such human possibilities be developed.

We have much to eliminate and much to acquire. It is necessary to take stock to know how much we have left over and how much we lack.

It is clear that the PLURALIZED I is superfluous, it is something useless and harmful.

IT IS LOGICAL to say that we have to develop certain powers, certain faculties, certain capacities that the MACHINE-MAN attributes to himself and believes he has but that in reality he DOES NOT-HAVE.

THE MACHINE-MAN believes that he has true INDIVIDUALITY, AWAKENED CONSCIOUSNESS, CONSCIOUS WILL, POWER TO DO, etc. and he has none of that.

If we want to stop being machines, if we want to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS, have true CONSCIOUS WILL, INDIVIDUALITY, ability to DO, it is urgent to start by knowing ourselves and then dissolve the PSYCHOLOGICAL I.

When the PLURALIZED I dissolves, only the TRUE BEING remains within us.
