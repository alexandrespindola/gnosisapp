THE MACHINE MAN is the unhappiest beast that exists in this vale of tears, yet he has the PRETENSION and even the INSOLENCE to SELF-TITLE himself KING OF NATURE.

"KNOW THYSELF" "MAN, KNOW THYSELF". This is an ancient GOLDEN MAXIM written on the unconquered walls of the temple of Delphi in ANCIENT GREECE.

Man, that poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL who mistakenly calls himself MAN, has invented thousands of extremely complicated and difficult machines and knows very well that in order to use a MACHINE, he sometimes needs long years of study and learning, but when it comes to HIMSELF he totally forgets this fact, even though he himself is a more complicated machine than all the ones he has invented.

There is no man who is not full of totally false ideas about himself, the most serious thing is that he does not want to realise that he really is a machine.

The human machine has no freedom of movement, it functions only by multiple and varied internal influences and external shocks.

All the movements, acts, words, ideas, emotions, feelings, desires, of the human machine are provoked by external influences and by multiple strange and difficult internal causes.

THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is a poor talking puppet with memory and vitality, a living doll, who has the silly illusion that he can DO, when in reality he can do nothing at all.

Imagine for a moment, dear reader, an automatic mechanical doll controlled by a complex mechanism.

Imagine that this doll has life, falls in love, speaks, walks, desires, makes wars, etc.

Imagine that this doll can change owners at any moment. You must imagine that each owner is a different person, has their own criteria, their own way of having fun, feeling, living, etc., etc., etc.

Any owner wanting to get money will press certain buttons and then the doll will dedicate itself to business, another owner, half an hour later or several hours later, will have a different idea and will put his doll to dance and laugh, a third will put it to fight, a fourth will make it fall in love with a woman, a fifth will make it fall in love with another, a sixth will make it fight with a neighbour and create a police problem, and a seventh will make it change address.

Really the doll in our example has not done anything but he believes that he has done, he has the illusion that he DOES when in reality he can do nothing because he does not have the INDIVIDUAL BEING.

Beyond any doubt everything has happened as when it rains, when it thunders, when the sun warms, but the poor doll believes that he DOES; he has the silly ILLUSION that he has done everything when in reality he has done nothing, it is his respective owners who have had fun with the poor mechanical doll.

Thus is the poor intellectual animal, dear reader, a mechanical doll like the one in our illustrative example, he believes that he DOES when in reality he DOES nothing, he is a puppet of flesh and blood controlled by LEGION OF SUBTLE ENERGETIC ENTITIES that together constitute what is called EGO, PLURALIZED SELF.

THE CHRISTIAN GOSPEL calls all those entities DEMONS and their true name is LEGION.

If we say that the SELF is a legion of DEMONS that control the human machine, we are not exaggerating, that is how it is.

THE MAN-MACHINE has no INDIVIDUALITY, he does not possess the BEING, only the TRUE BEING has the POWER TO DO.

ONLY the BEING can give us TRUE INDIVIDUALITY, only the BEING transforms us into TRUE MEN.

Whoever truly wants to stop being a simple mechanical doll, must eliminate each one of those entities that together constitute the SELF. Each one of those ENTITIES that play with the human machine. Whoever truly wants to stop being a simple mechanical doll, has to start by admitting and understanding their own mechanicality.

He who does not want to understand or accept his own mechanicality, he who does not want to correctly understand this fact, can no longer change, he is an unhappy person, a wretch, he would be better off hanging a millstone around his neck and throwing himself into the depths of the sea.

THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is a machine, but a very special machine, if this machine comes to understand that it is a MACHINE, if it is well driven and if circumstances allow, it can stop being a machine and become a MAN.

Above all, it is urgent to start by understanding deeply and at all levels of the mind, that we do not have true individuality, that we do not have a PERMANENT CENTRE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, that at a given moment we are one person and at another, another; everything depends on the ENTITY that controls the situation at any instant.

That which originates the ILLUSION of the UNITY and INTEGRITY of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is on the one hand the sensation that his PHYSICAL BODY has, on the other hand his name and surnames and lastly the memory and a certain number of mechanical habits implanted in him by EDUCATION, or acquired by simple and silly imitation.

The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL will not be able to stop BEING a MACHINE, he will not be able to change, he will not be able to acquire the TRUE INDIVIDUAL BEING and become a legitimate man, as long as he does NOT have the courage to ELIMINATE THROUGH DEEP UNDERSTANDING and in successive order, each one of those METAPHYSICAL entities that together constitute what is called EGO, SELF, MYSELF.

Each IDEA, each PASSION, each vice, each AFFECTION, each HATRED, each desire, etc., etc., etc. has its corresponding ENTITY and the set of all those ENTITIES is the PLURALIZED SELF of REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY.

All those METAPHYSICAL ENTITIES, all those SELVES that together constitute the EGO, have no true link between them, they have no coordinates of any type. Each one of those ENTITIES depends totally on the circumstances, change of impressions, events, etc.

The SCREEN OF THE MIND changes colours and scenes at every instant, everything depends on the ENTITY that controls the mind at any instant.

Through the SCREEN of the mind pass in continuous procession the different ENTITIES that together constitute the EGO or PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF.

The diverse ENTITIES that constitute the PLURALIZED SELF associate, dissociate, form certain special groups according to their affinities, quarrel with each other, argue, do not know each other, etc., etc., etc.

Each ENTITY of the LEGION called SELF, each small SELF, believes to be the whole, the TOTAL EGO, it does not remotely suspect that it is only a tiny part.

The ENTITY that today swears eternal love to a woman, is displaced later by another ENTITY that has nothing to do with such oath and then the house of cards falls to the ground and the poor woman cries disappointed.

The ENTITY that today swears loyalty to a cause, is displaced tomorrow by another ENTITY that has nothing to do with such cause and then the subject retires.

The ENTITY that today swears loyalty to GNOSIS, is displaced tomorrow by another ENTITY that hates GNOSIS.

The Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities, must study this book of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION and out of humanity have the courage to guide the pupils along the marvellous path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

It is necessary that the pupils understand the need to know themselves in all areas of the mind.

A more efficient intellectual orientation is needed, it is necessary to understand what we are and this must begin from the very desks of the School.

We do not deny that money is needed to eat, pay the rent of the house and dress ourselves.

We do not deny that intellectual preparation, a profession, a technique are needed to earn money, but that is not everything, that is secondary.

The first, the fundamental thing is to know who we are, what we are, where we come from, where we are going, what is the purpose of our existence.

It is regrettable to continue as automatic dolls, miserable mortals, man-machines.

It is urgent to stop being mere machines, it is urgent to become TRUE MEN.

A radical change is needed and this must begin precisely with the ELIMINATION of each one of those ENTITIES that together constitute the PLURALIZED SELF.

The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is not MAN but has within himself in a latent state, all the possibilities to become MAN.

It is NOT a law that these possibilities are developed, the most natural thing is that they are lost.

ONLY through tremendous SUPER-EFFORTS can such human possibilities be developed.

Much we have to eliminate and much we have to acquire. It is necessary to take an inventory to know how much we have too much and how much we lack.

It is clear that the PLURALIZED SELF is superfluous, it is something useless and harmful.

IT IS LOGICAL to say that we have to develop certain powers, certain faculties, certain capacities that the MAN-MACHINE attributes to himself and believes to have but that in reality he DOES NOT HAVE.

THE MAN-MACHINE believes that he has true INDIVIDUALITY, AWAKENED CONSCIOUSNESS, CONSCIOUS WILL, POWER TO DO, etc. and he has none of that.

If we want to stop being machines, if we want to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS, have true CONSCIOUS WILL, INDIVIDUALITY, capacity to DO, it is urgent to start by knowing ourselves and then dissolve the PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF.

When the PLURALIZED SELF dissolves only the TRUE BEING remains inside us.
