A man was born, lived for sixty-five years, and died. But where was he before 1900, and where might he be after 1965? Official science knows nothing about all this. This is the general formulation of all questions about life and death.

Axiomatically, we can affirm: "MAN DIES BECAUSE HIS TIME ENDS, THERE IS NO TOMORROW FOR THE DEAD PERSON'S PERSONALITY."

Each day is a wave of time, each month is another wave of time, each year is also another wave of time, and all these waves chained together constitute the GREAT WAVE OF LIFE.

Time is round, and the life of the HUMAN PERSONALITY is a closed curve.

The life of the HUMAN PERSONALITY develops in its time, is born in its time, and dies in its time; it can never exist beyond its time.

This matter of time is a problem that has been studied by many wise people. Without a doubt, time is the FOURTH DIMENSION.

EUCLID's Geometry is only applicable to the THREE-DIMENSIONAL world, but the world has seven dimensions, and the FOURTH is TIME.

The human mind conceives of ETERNITY as the prolongation of time in a straight line; nothing could be more wrong than this concept because ETERNITY is the FIFTH DIMENSION.

Each moment of existence occurs in time and is repeated eternally.

Death and LIFE are two extremes that touch. One life ends for the man who dies, but another begins. One time ends, and another begins; death is intimately linked to the ETERNAL RETURN.

This means that we have to return, to come back to this world after death to repeat the same drama of existence, but if the human PERSONALITY perishes with death, who or what is it that returns?

It is necessary to clarify once and for all that the I is the one that continues after death, that the I is the one that returns, that the I is the one that returns to this vale of tears.

It is necessary that our readers do not confuse the Law of RETURN with the Theory of REINCARNATION taught by MODERN THEOSOPHY.

The aforementioned theory of REINCARNATION originated in the cult of KRISHNA, which is a HINDUSTANI RELIGION of the Vedic type, unfortunately retouched and adulterated by reformers.

In the authentic original cult of Krishna, only the Heroes, the Guides, those who already possess SACRED INDIVIDUALITY, are the only ones who reincarnate.

THE PLURALIZED I RETURNS, comes back, but this is not REINCARNATION. The masses, the multitudes RETURN, but that is not REINCARNATION.

The idea of the RETURN of things and phenomena, the idea of eternal repetition, is not very old, and we can find it in PYTHAGOREAN WISDOM and in the ancient cosmogony of HINDUSTAN.

The eternal return of the Days and Nights of BRAHAMA, the incessant repetition of the KALPAS, etc., are invariably associated in a very intimate way with Pythagorean Wisdom and the Law of eternal RECURRENCE or eternal RETURN.

Gautama the BUDDHA very wisely taught the DOCTRINE of ETERNAL RETURN and the wheel of successive lives, but his DOCTRINE was greatly adulterated by his followers.

Every RETURN implies, of course, the fabrication of a new HUMAN PERSONALITY; this is formed during the first seven years of childhood.

The family environment, street life, and school give the HUMAN PERSONALITY its original characteristic hue.

The EXAMPLE of the elders is definitive for the infantile personality.

The child learns more from example than from precept. The wrong way of living, the absurd example, the degenerate customs of the elders, give the child's personality that peculiar skeptical and perverse hue of the era in which we live.

In these modern times, adultery has become more common than potatoes and onions, and, as is only logical, this gives rise to Dantean scenes within homes.

There are many children these days who have to endure, full of pain and resentment, the whips and sticks of the stepfather or stepmother. It is clear that in this way, the child's PERSONALITY develops within the framework of pain, resentment, and hatred.

There is a vulgar saying that goes: "Someone else's child smells bad everywhere." Naturally, there are also exceptions to this, but these can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and there are fingers to spare.

Altercations between the father and mother over jealousy, the crying and lamentations of the afflicted mother or the oppressed, ruined, and desperate husband leave an indelible mark of deep pain and melancholy on the child's PERSONALITY that is never forgotten throughout life.

In elegant houses, proud ladies mistreat their maids when they go to the beauty salon or put on makeup. The pride of the ladies feels mortally wounded.

The child who sees all these scenes of infamy feels hurt to the core, whether he takes the side of his haughty and proud mother or the side of the unhappy, vain, and humiliated maid, and the result is usually catastrophic for the CHILDHOOD PERSONALITY.

Since television was invented, the unity of the family has been lost. In other times, the man would come home from the street and be received by his wife with great joy. Nowadays, the woman no longer goes out to greet her husband at the door because she is busy watching television.

Within modern homes, the father, mother, sons, and daughters seem like unconscious automatons in front of the television screen.

Now the husband cannot discuss absolutely anything with his wife about the problems of the day, work, etc., etc., because she seems like a sleepwalker watching yesterday's film, the Dantean scenes of Al Capone, the latest dance of the new wave, etc., etc., etc.

Children raised in this new type of ultramodern home only think of toy cannons, pistols, and machine guns to imitate and live out in their own way all the Dantean scenes of crime as they have seen them on the television screen.

It is a pity that this wonderful invention of television is used for destructive purposes. If humanity were to use this invention in a dignified way, either to study the natural sciences, or to teach the true royal art of MOTHER NATURE, or to give sublime teachings to the people, then this invention would be a blessing for humanity; it could be used intelligently to cultivate the human personality.

It is obviously absurd to nourish the CHILDHOOD PERSONALITY with arrhythmic, inharmonious, vulgar music. It is stupid to nourish the PERSONALITY of children with stories of thieves and policemen, scenes of vice and prostitution, dramas of adultery, pornography, etc.

We can see the result of such a procedure in the Rebels without a Cause, the premature murderers, etc.

It is regrettable that mothers whip their children, beat them, insult them with broken and cruel words. The result of such conduct is resentment, hatred, loss of love, etc.

In practice, we have been able to see that children raised among sticks, whips, and shouts become vulgar people full of boorishness and lacking any sense of respect and veneration.

It is urgent to understand the need to establish a true balance within homes.

It is essential to know that sweetness and severity must be mutually balanced on the two plates of the scales of justice.

The FATHER represents SEVERITY, The MOTHER represents SWEETNESS. The Father personifies WISDOM. The MOTHER symbolizes LOVE.

WISDOM and LOVE, SEVERITY and SWEETNESS are mutually balanced on the two plates of the cosmic scale.

Fathers and Mothers of families must balance each other for the good of homes.

It is urgent, it is necessary, that all Fathers and Mothers of families understand the need to sow in the infantile mind the ETERNAL VALUES of the SPIRIT.

It is regrettable that modern children no longer possess the sense of VENERATION; this is because the stories of cowboy thieves and policemen, television, cinema, etc., have perverted the minds of children.

The REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY of the GNOSTIC MOVEMENT, in a clear and precise way, makes a fundamental distinction between the EGO and the ESSENCE.

During the first three or four years of life, only the beauty of the ESSENCE is manifested in the child; then the child is tender, sweet, beautiful in all its Psychological aspects.

When the EGO begins to control the tender personality of the child, all that beauty of the ESSENCE disappears, and in its place, the Psychological defects characteristic of all human beings emerge.

Just as we must distinguish between EGO and ESSENCE, it is also necessary to distinguish between PERSONALITY and ESSENCE.

The human being is born with the ESSENCE but is not born with the PERSONALITY; the latter needs to be created.

PERSONALITY and ESSENCE must develop in a harmonious and balanced way.

In practice, we have been able to verify that when the PERSONALITY develops exaggeratedly at the expense of the ESSENCE, the result is the SCOUNDREL.

The observation and experience of many years have allowed us to understand that when the ESSENCE develops totally without paying the slightest attention to the harmonious cultivation of the PERSONALITY, the result is the mystic without intellect, without personality, noble of heart but maladapted, incapable.

The HARMONIOUS development of PERSONALITY and ESSENCE results in brilliant men and women.

In the ESSENCE, we have everything that is our own; in the PERSONALITY, everything that is borrowed.

In the ESSENCE, we have our innate qualities; in the PERSONALITY, we have the example of our elders, what we have learned at Home, at School, in the Street.

It is urgent that children receive food for the ESSENCE and food for the PERSONALITY.

The ESSENCE is nourished with tenderness, limitless affection, love, music, flowers, beauty, harmony, etc.

The PERSONALITY must be nourished with the good example of our elders, with the wise teaching of the school, etc.

It is essential that children enter primary school at the age of seven, having previously attended kindergarten.

Children should learn the first letters by playing, so that study becomes attractive, delightful, and happy for them.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION teaches that from KINDERGARTEN or nursery school onwards, special attention should be paid to each of the three aspects of the HUMAN PERSONALITY, known as thought, movement, and action, so that the child's personality develops in a harmonious and balanced way.

The question of the creation of the child's PERSONALITY and its development is a matter of very serious responsibility for FAMILY PARENTS and SCHOOL TEACHERS.

The quality of the HUMAN PERSONALITY depends exclusively on the type of Psychological material with which it was created and nourished.

Around PERSONALITY, ESSENCE, EGO or I, there is a lot of confusion among PSYCHOLOGY students.

Some confuse PERSONALITY with ESSENCE, and others confuse EGO or I with ESSENCE.

There are many Pseudo-Esoteric or Pseudo-Occultist Schools that have as their goal the IMPERSONAL LIFE.

It is necessary to clarify that it is not the PERSONALITY that we have to dissolve.

It is urgent to know that we need to disintegrate the EGO, the ME MYSELF, the I, reduce it to cosmic dust.

The PERSONALITY is only a vehicle of action, a vehicle that was necessary to create, to manufacture.

In the world, there are CALIGULAS, ATTILAS, HITLERS, etc. Any type of personality, however perverse it may have been, can be radically transformed when the EGO or I is totally dissolved.

This business of the Dissolution of the EGO or I confuses and bothers many Pseudo-Esotericists. They are convinced that the EGO is DIVINE; they believe that the EGO or I is the same BEING, the DIVINE MONAD, etc.

It is necessary, it is urgent, it is imperative to understand that the EGO or I has nothing DIVINE about it.

The EGO or I is the SATAN of the BIBLE, a bundle of memories, desires, passions, hatreds, resentments, concupiscence, adulteries, inheritance of family, races, nation, etc., etc., etc.

Many stupidly affirm that there exists within us a SUPERIOR or DIVINE I and an INFERIOR I.

SUPERIOR and INFERIOR are always two sections of the same thing. SUPERIOR I, INFERIOR I, are two sections of the same EGO.

The DIVINAL BEING, the MONAD, the INTIMATE, has nothing to do with any form of the I. BEING is BEING, and that's all. The Reason for BEING is the same BEING.

The PERSONALITY in itself is only a vehicle and nothing more. The EGO or the BEING can manifest itself through the personality; it all depends on ourselves.

It is URGENT to dissolve the I, the EGO, so that only the PSYCHOLOGICAL ESSENCE of our TRUE BEING is manifested through our PERSONALITY.

It is essential that EDUCATORS fully understand the need to cultivate harmoniously the three aspects of the HUMAN PERSONALITY.

A perfect balance between personality and ESSENCE, a harmonious development of THOUGHT, EMOTION and MOVEMENT, a REVOLUTIONARY ETHIC,
constitute the foundations of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.
