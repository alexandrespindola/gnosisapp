GOOD and EVIL do not exist. Something is good when it suits us, and bad when it doesn't suit us. GOOD and EVIL are a matter of selfish conveniences and whims of the mind.

The man who invented the fateful terms GOOD and EVIL was an Atlantean named MAKARI KRONVERNKZYON, a distinguished member of the AKALDAN Scientific Society, located on the submerged continent of Atlantis.

The old archaic sage never suspected the serious damage he would cause to humanity with the invention of his two little words.

The Atlantean sages deeply studied all the EVOLUTIONARY, INVOLUTIONARY and NEUTRAL FORCES OF NATURE, but it occurred to this old sage to define the first two with the terms GOOD AND EVIL. He called the EVOLUTIONARY forces good and baptized the INVOLUTIONARY forces with the term bad. He gave the neutral forces no name.

These forces are processed within man and within nature, the neutral force being the point of support and balance.

Many centuries after the sinking of ATLANTIS with its famous POISEDONIS of which Plato speaks in his Republic, there existed in the oriental TIKLYAMISHAYANA civilization a very ancient priest who committed the very serious error of abusing the terms GOOD and EVIL, clumsily using them to base a morality on them. The name of said priest was ARMANATOORA.

With the passage of history through countless centuries, humanity became addicted to these two little words and turned them into the foundation of all its moral codes. Today one finds these two little words even in the soup.

Currently there are many REFORMERS who want MORAL RESTORATION but who, unfortunately for them and for this afflicted world, have their minds bottled up between GOOD and EVIL.

All morality is based on the little words GOOD and EVIL, that is why every MORAL REFORMER is in fact a REACTIONARY.

The terms GOOD and EVIL always serve to JUSTIFY or CONDEMN our own mistakes.

He who justifies or condemns does not understand. It is intelligent to understand the development of EVOLUTIONARY forces but it is not intelligent to justify them with the term GOOD. It is intelligent to understand the processes of involutionary forces but it is stupid to condemn them with the term BAD.

Every centrifugal force can become a centripetal force. Every involutionary force can be transformed into EVOLUTIONARY.

Within the infinite processes of energy in the EVOLUTIONARY state, there are infinite processes of energy in the INVOLUTIONARY state.

Within each human being there are different types of energy that EVOLVE, INVOLVE and transform incessantly.

Justifying a certain type of energy and condemning another is not understanding. What is vital is to understand.

The experience of THE TRUTH has been very rare among humanity due to the concrete fact of mental bottling. People are bottled up between the opposites GOOD and EVIL.

The REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY of the GNOSTIC MOVEMENT is based on the study of the different types of energy that operate within the human organism and within nature.

THE GNOSTIC MOVEMENT has a REVOLUTIONARY ETHIC that has nothing to do with the morality of the reactionaries nor with the conservative and delaying terms of GOOD and EVIL.

Within the Psycho-Physiological laboratory of the human organism there are evolutionary, involutionary and neutral forces that must be studied and understood deeply.

The term GOOD prevents the UNDERSTANDING of EVOLUTIONARY energies due to justification.

The term EVIL prevents the understanding of INVOLUTIONARY forces due to condemnation.

To justify or condemn does not mean to understand. Anyone who wants to get rid of their defects should not justify or condemn them. It is urgent to UNDERSTAND our mistakes.

Understanding ANGER on all levels of the mind is essential for serenity and sweetness to be born in us.

Understanding the infinite nuances of greed is essential for philanthropy and altruism to be born in us.

Understanding lust on all levels of the mind is an indispensable condition for true chastity to be born in us.

Understanding envy in all areas of the mind is sufficient for the sense of cooperation and happiness for the well-being and progress of others to be born in us.

Understanding pride in all its nuances and degrees is the basis for the exotic flower of humility to be born in us in a natural and simple way.

Understanding what that element of inertia called laziness is, not only in its grotesque forms but also in its most subtle forms, is indispensable for the sense of activity to be born in us.

Understanding the various forms of GULA and gluttony is equivalent to destroying the vices of the instinctive center such as banquets, drunkenness, hunting, carnivorism, fear of death, desires to perpetuate the I, fear of annihilation, etc.

School, college and university teachers advise their disciples to improve as if the I could improve, to acquire certain virtues as if the I could achieve virtues, etc.

It is urgent to understand that the I never improves, that it is never more perfect and that whoever covets virtues strengthens the I.

TOTAL PERFECTION is only born in us with the dissolution of the I. Virtues are born in us in a natural and simple way when we understand our psychological defects not only on the intellectual level but also in all the subconscious and unconscious areas of the mind.

Wanting to improve is stupid, desiring holiness is envy, coveting virtues means strengthening the I with the poison of greed.

We need the total death of the I not only on the intellectual level but also in all the nooks, regions, terrains and corridors of the mind. When we have died absolutely, only THAT which is PERFECT remains in us. THAT which is saturated with virtues, THAT which is the ESSENCE of our INTIMATE BEING, THAT which is not of time.

Only by thoroughly understanding all the infinite processes of the evolutionary forces that develop within ourselves here and now. Only by integrally understanding the different aspects of the INVOLUTIONARY forces that are processed within ourselves from moment to moment, can we dissolve the I.

The terms GOOD and EVIL serve to JUSTIFY and CONDEMN but never to understand.

Each defect has many nuances, backgrounds, subtexts and depths. Understanding a defect on the intellectual level does not mean having understood it in the different subconscious, unconscious and infraconscious areas of the mind.

Any defect can disappear from the intellectual level and continue in the other areas of the mind.

ANGER disguises itself with the toga of the Judge. Many covet not being greedy, there are those who do not covet money but covet Psychic powers, virtues, loves, happiness here or after death, etc., etc., etc.

Many men and women are moved and fascinated by people of the opposite sex "SUPPOSEDLY" because they love beauty, their own subconscious betrays them, LUST disguises itself with the aesthetic sense.

Many envious people envy the saints and do penance and whip themselves because they also want to become SAINTS.

Many envious people envy those who sacrifice themselves for humanity and then, wanting to be great too, make a mockery of those they envy and launch all their defamatory saliva against them.

There are those who feel proud of their position, money, fame and prestige and there are those who feel proud of their humble condition.

Diogenes felt proud of the Barrel in which he slept and when he arrived at Socrates' house he greeted saying: "Treading on your pride Socrates, treading on your pride". "Yes, Diogenes, with your pride you tread on my pride." Was Socrates' reply.

Vain women curl their hair, dress and adorn themselves with everything they can to awaken the envy of other women, but Vanity also disguises itself with the tunic of humility.

Tradition has it that Aristippus the Greek philosopher, wanting to demonstrate to everyone his wisdom and his humility, dressed in a very old tunic full of holes, held in his right hand the staff of Philosophy and went through the streets of Athens. When Socrates saw him coming, he exclaimed: "Your vanity is seen through the holes in your garment, oh Aristippus".

Many are those who are in misery due to the element laziness, but there are people who work too hard to earn a living but are too lazy to study and know themselves in order to dissolve the I.

Many have abandoned Gula and Gluttony but unfortunately they get drunk and go hunting.

Each defect is multifaceted and develops and processes gradually from the lowest rung of the Psychological scale to the highest rung.

Within the delightful cadence of a verse, the crime is also hidden.

The crime is also dressed as a Saint, a Martyr, a chaste, an Apostle, etc.

GOOD and EVIL do not exist, these terms only serve to seek evasions and avoid the deep and detailed study of our own defects.
