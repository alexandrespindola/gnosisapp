It is now completely proven that FEAR prevents free INITIATIVE. The poor economic situation of millions of people is undoubtedly due to this thing called FEAR.

The frightened child looks for their beloved mother and clings to her in search of security. The frightened husband clings to his wife and feels that he loves her much more. The frightened wife looks for her husband and children and feels she loves them much more.

From a psychological point of view, it is very curious and interesting to know that fear is sometimes disguised as LOVE.

People who internally have very few SPIRITUAL VALUES, internally poor people, always look for something outside to complete themselves.

Internally poor people live always intriguing, always in nonsense, gossip, bestial pleasures, etc.

Internally poor people live in fear after fear, and as is natural, cling to their husband, wife, parents, children, old outdated and degenerate traditions, etc. etc. etc.

Every old person who is sick and psychologically poor is usually full of fear and terrified with infinite anxiety of money, family traditions, grandchildren, their memories, etc., as if seeking security. This is something that we can all see by carefully observing the elderly.

Whenever people are afraid, they hide behind the protective shield of RESPECTABILITY. Following a tradition, whether of race, family, nation, etc. etc. etc.

Really, every tradition is a mere repetition without any sense, hollow, without true value.

All people have a marked tendency to IMITATE what belongs to others. This IMITATING is a product of FEAR.

People with fear IMITATE all those they cling to. They imitate the husband, the wife, the children, the siblings, the friends who protect them, etc. etc. etc.

IMITATION is the result of FEAR. IMITATION completely destroys FREE INITIATIVE.

In schools, colleges, and universities, teachers make the mistake of teaching male and female students this thing called IMITATION.

In painting and drawing classes, students are taught to copy, to paint images of trees, houses, mountains, animals, etc. That is not creating. That is IMITATING, PHOTOGRAPHING.

Creating is not IMITATING. Creating is not PHOTOGRAPHING. Creating is translating, transmitting with the brush and in a lively way the tree that enchants us, the beautiful sunset, the sunrise with its ineffable melodies, etc. etc.

There is true creation in CHINESE AND JAPANESE ZEN art, in abstract and Semi-Abstract art.

Any Chinese CHAN and ZEN painter is not interested in IMITATING, photographing. The painters of China and Japan: enjoy creating and creating again.

The painters of ZEN and CHAN do not imitate, they CREATE and that is their job.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN are not interested in painting or photographing a beautiful woman, they enjoy transmitting her abstract beauty.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN would never imitate a beautiful sunset, they enjoy transmitting in abstract beauty all the charm of the sunset.

The important thing is not to IMITATE, to copy in black or white; the important thing is to feel the deep significance of beauty and know how to transmit it, but for this there needs to be no fear, no attachment to rules, to tradition, or fear of what they will say or the teacher's scolding.

It is URGENT that teachers understand the need for students to develop creative power.

It is patently absurd to teach students to IMITATE. It is better to teach them to create.

Human beings, unfortunately, are sleeping unconscious automatons who only know how to IMITATE.

We imitate other people's clothes, and from this imitation come the different trends in fashion.

We imitate other people's customs, even when they are very wrong.

We imitate vices, we imitate everything that is absurd, what is always repeated in time, etc.

It is necessary for SCHOOL TEACHERS to teach students to think for themselves independently.

Teachers must offer students all the possibilities so that they stop being IMITATIVE AUTOMATONS.

Teachers should provide students with the best opportunities for them to develop creative power.

It is URGENT that students know true freedom, so that without any fear they can learn to think for themselves, freely.

The mind that lives enslaved to WHAT WILL THEY SAY, the mind that IMITATES, for fear of violating traditions, rules, customs, etc. It is not a creative mind, it is not a free mind.

People's minds are like houses closed and sealed with seven seals, houses where nothing new can happen, houses where the sun does not enter, houses where only death and pain reign.

The NEW can only happen where there is no fear, where there is no IMITATION, where there is no attachment to things, to money, to people, to traditions, to customs, etc.

People live enslaved to intrigue, envy, family customs, habits, the insatiable desire to gain positions, climb, rise, climb to the top of the ladder, make themselves felt, etc. etc.

It is URGENT that TEACHERS teach their male and female students the need not to IMITATE this entire outdated and degenerate order of old things.

It is URGENT that STUDENTS learn at school to create freely, to think freely, to feel freely.

Students spend the best part of their lives at school acquiring INFORMATION and yet they do not have time to think about all these things.

Ten or fifteen years at school living the life of unconscious automatons and they leave school with a sleeping consciousness, but they leave school believing they are very awake.

The human mind lives bottled up between conservative and reactionary ideas.

Human beings cannot think with true freedom because they are full of FEAR.

Human beings are AFRAID of life, AFRAID of death, AFRAID of what people will say, of what is said to be said, of gossip, of losing their jobs, of violating regulations, of someone taking away their spouse or stealing their spouse, etc., etc., etc.

At school we are taught to IMITATE and we leave school as IMITATORS.

We do not have free INITIATIVE because from the school benches we were taught to IMITATE.

People IMITATE for fear of what other people may say, students IMITATE because TEACHERS really have the poor students terrified, they are threatened at every moment, they are threatened with a bad grade, they are threatened with certain punishments, they are threatened with expulsion, etc.

If we really want to become creators in the fullest sense of the word, we must become aware of all that series of IMITATIONS that unfortunately have us trapped.

When we are already capable of knowing all the series of IMITATIONS, when we have already carefully analysed each of the IMITATIONS, we become aware of them and as a logical consequence, the power to create is then born in us spontaneously.

It is necessary for school, college or university students to free themselves from all IMITATION in order to become true creators.

Teachers who mistakenly assume that students need to IMITATE in order to learn are wrong. He who IMITATES does not learn, he who IMITATES becomes an AUTOMATON and that is all.

It is not about IMITATING what the authors of geography, physics, arithmetic, history, etc. say. IMITATING, MEMORISING, repeating like parrots or parrots, is stupid, it is better to CONSCIOUSLY UNDERSTAND what we are studying.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is the SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, the science that allows us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things.

The mind that only knows how to IMITATE is MECHANICAL, it is a machine that works, it is NOT creative, it is not capable of creating, it does not really think, it only repeats and that is all.

Teachers should be concerned about the awakening of CONSCIOUSNESS in each student.

Students are only concerned with passing the year and then... outside of school, in practical life, they become office employees or baby-making machines.

Ten or fifteen years of studies to end up as talking automatons, the subjects studied are gradually forgotten and in the end nothing remains in memory.

If students were AWARE of the subjects studied, if their study was not based solely on INFORMATION, IMITATION and MEMORY, it would be a different story. They would leave school with CONSCIOUS, UNFORGETTABLE, COMPLETE knowledge, which would not be subject to UNFAITHFUL MEMORY.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION will help students by awakening their CONSCIOUSNESS and INTELLIGENCE.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION leads young people on the path of TRUE REVOLUTION.

Students must insist that TEACHERS give them TRUE EDUCATION, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

It is not enough for students to sit in the school benches to receive information about some king or some war, something more is needed, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is needed to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS.

It is URGENT that students leave school mature, truly CONSCIOUS, INTELLIGENT, so that they do not become simple automatic pieces of the social machinery.
