It is now fully proven that FEAR prevents free INITIATIVE. The poor economic situation of millions of people is undoubtedly due to this thing called FEAR.

The frightened child looks for his beloved mother and clings to her in search of security. The frightened husband clings to his wife and feels that he loves her much more. The frightened wife looks for her husband and children and feels she loves them much more.

From a psychological point of view, it is very curious and interesting to know that fear sometimes disguises itself in the clothes of LOVE.

People who internally have very few SPIRITUAL VALUES, people who are internally poor, always look for something outside to complete themselves.

Internally poor people live always scheming, always in nonsense, gossip, bestial pleasures, etc.

Internally poor people live in fear after fear and, as is natural, cling to their husband, wife, parents, children, old, outdated and degenerate traditions, etc. etc. etc.

Every old, sick and psychologically poor person is usually full of fear and is terrified with infinite anxiety of money, family traditions, grandchildren, their memories, etc., as if seeking security. This is something that we can all see by carefully observing the elderly.

Whenever people are afraid, they hide behind the protective shield of RESPECTABILITY. Following a tradition, whether of race, family, nation, etc. etc. etc.

Really every tradition is a mere repetition without any sense, hollow, without true value.

All people have a marked tendency to IMITATE what is foreign. That of IMITATING is a product of FEAR.

People with fear IMITATE all those to whom they cling. They imitate the husband, the wife, the children, the brothers, the friends who protect them, etc. etc. etc.

IMITATION is the result of FEAR. IMITATION completely destroys FREE INITIATIVE.

In schools, in colleges, in universities, teachers make the mistake of teaching male and female students that thing called IMITATION.

In painting and drawing classes, students are taught to copy, to paint images of trees, houses, mountains, animals, etc. That is not creating. That is IMITATING, PHOTOGRAPHING.

Creating is not IMITATING. Creating is not PHOTOGRAPHING. Creating is translating, transmitting with the brush and to the living the tree that enchants us, the beautiful sunset, the dawn with its ineffable melodies, etc. etc.

There is true creation in the CHINESE AND JAPANESE ART OF ZEN, in abstract and semi-abstract art.

Any Chinese painter of CHAN and ZEN is not interested in IMITATING, photographing. The painters of China and Japan: enjoy creating and recreating again.

The painters of ZEN and CHAN do not imitate, they CREATE, and that is their work.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN are not interested in painting or photographing a beautiful woman, they enjoy transmitting her abstract beauty.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN would never imitate a beautiful sunset, they enjoy transmitting in abstract beauty all the charm of the sunset.

The important thing is not to IMITATE, to copy in black or white; the important thing is to feel the deep significance of beauty and to know how to transmit it, but for that it is necessary that there is no fear, attachment to rules, to tradition, or fear of what they will say or the teacher's scolding.

It is URGENT that teachers understand the need for students to develop creative power.

It is obviously absurd to teach students to IMITATE. It is better to teach them to create.

The human being, unfortunately, is an unconscious, sleeping automaton that only knows how to IMITATE.

We imitate other people's clothes and from that imitation come the different currents of fashion.

We imitate other people's customs even when these are very wrong.

We imitate vices, we imitate everything that is absurd, what is always repeated in time, etc.

It is necessary that SCHOOL TEACHERS teach students to think for themselves independently.

Teachers must offer students every opportunity to stop being IMITATIVE AUTOMATONS.

Teachers must provide students with the best opportunities to develop creative power.

It is URGENT that students know true freedom, so that without any fear they can learn to think for themselves, freely.

The mind that lives enslaved by WHAT THEY WILL SAY, the mind that IMITATES, for fear of violating traditions, rules, customs, etc. is not a creative mind, it is not a free mind.

The mind of people is like a house closed and sealed with seven seals, a house where nothing new can happen, a house where the sun does not enter, a house where only death and pain reign.

The NEW can only happen where there is no fear, where there is no IMITATION, where there are no attachments to things, to money, to people, to traditions, to customs, etc.

People live enslaved by intrigue, envy, family customs, habits, the insatiable desire to gain positions, climb, go up, climb to the top of the ladder, make themselves felt, etc. etc.

It is URGENT that TEACHERS teach their male and female students the need not to IMITATE this outdated and degenerate order of old things.

It is URGENT that STUDENTS learn in school to create freely, to think freely, to feel freely.

Students spend the best part of their lives in school acquiring INFORMATION and yet they have no time to think about all these things.

Ten or fifteen years in school living the life of unconscious automatons and they leave school with their consciousness asleep, but they leave school believing they are very awake.

The human mind lives bottled up between conservative and reactionary ideas.

The human being cannot think with true freedom because he is full of FEAR.

The human being is AFRAID of life, AFRAID of death, AFRAID of what they will say, of what is said to be said, of gossip, of losing their job, of violating regulations, of someone taking their spouse away or stealing their spouse, etc., etc., etc.

In school we are taught to IMITATE and we leave school converted into IMITATORS.

We do not have free INITIATIVE because from the school benches we were taught to IMITATE.

People IMITATE for fear of what other people may say, students IMITATE because TEACHERS really terrify the poor students, they are threatened at every moment, they are threatened with a bad grade, they are threatened with certain punishments, they are threatened with expulsion, etc.

If we really want to become creators in the fullest sense of the word, we must become aware of all those IMITATIONS that unfortunately have us trapped.

When we are already able to know the whole series of IMITATIONS, when we have already carefully analysed each of the IMITATIONS, we become aware of them and as a logical consequence, the power to create is then born in us spontaneously.

It is necessary that the students of the school, college or university, free themselves from all IMITATION so that they become true creators.

Teachers who mistakenly assume that students need to IMITATE to learn are wrong. He who IMITATES does not learn, he who IMITATES becomes an AUTOMATON and that is all.

It is not about IMITATING what the authors of geography, physics, arithmetic, history, etc. say. IMITATING, MEMORISING, repeating like parrots, is stupid, it is better to CONSCIOUSLY UNDERSTAND what we are studying.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is the SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, the science that allows us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things.

The mind that only knows how to IMITATE is MECHANICAL, it is a machine that works, it is NOT creative, it is not capable of creating, it does not really think, it only repeats and that is all.

Teachers should worry about the awakening of CONSCIOUSNESS in each student.

The students only worry about passing the year and then... outside of school, in practical life, they become office employees or little machines for making children.

Ten or fifteen years of studies to come out converted into talking automatons, the subjects studied are gradually forgotten and in the end nothing remains in the memory.

If the students were to make CONSCIOUSNESS of the subjects studied, if their study was not based solely on INFORMATION, IMITATION and MEMORY, it would be a different story. They would leave school with CONSCIOUS, UNFORGETTABLE, COMPLETE knowledge, which would not be subject to FAITHFUL MEMORY.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION will help students by awakening their CONSCIOUSNESS and INTELLIGENCE.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION leads young people on the path of TRUE REVOLUTION.

Students must insist that TEACHERS give them TRUE EDUCATION, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

It is not enough for students to sit on school benches to receive information about some king or some war, something more is needed, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is needed to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS.

It is URGENT that students leave school mature, truly CONSCIOUS, INTELLIGENT, so that they do not become simple automatic parts of the social machinery.
