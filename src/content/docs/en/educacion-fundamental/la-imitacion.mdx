It has already been fully demonstrated that FEAR prevents free INITIATIVE. The bad economic situation of millions of people is undoubtedly due to that which is called FEAR.

The frightened child looks for his dear little mother and clings to her for security. The frightened husband clings to his wife and feels that he loves her all the more. The frightened wife seeks out her husband and children and feels she loves them all the more.

From a psychological point of view it is very curious and interesting to know that fear is sometimes disguised in the clothes of LOVE.

People who internally have very few SPIRITUAL VALUES, people who are internally poor, are always looking for something outside to complete themselves.

Inwardly poor people live, always scheming, always in foolishness, gossip, beastly pleasures, etc.

Inwardly poor people live from fear to fear, and as is natural, they become attached to their husbands, wives, parents, children, old, outdated and degenerate traditions, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

Every sick and PSYCHOLOGICALLY poor old man is usually full of fear and is terrified of money, family traditions, grandchildren, his memories, etc., as if he were looking for security. This is something that we can all see by carefully observing the elderly.

Whenever people are afraid they hide behind the protective shield of RESPECTABILITY. Following a tradition, be it of race, be it of family, nation, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

In reality all tradition is mere repetition, meaningless, hollow, of no real value.

All people have a marked tendency to IMITATE what is not their own. This IMITATING is a product of FEAR.

People with fear IMITATE all those to whom they are attached. They imitate their husband, their wife, their children, their siblings, their friends who protect them, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

IMITATION is the result of FEAR. IMITATION totally destroys FREE INITIATIVE.

In schools, colleges and universities, teachers make the mistake of teaching male and female students what is called IMITATION.

In painting and drawing classes, students are taught to copy, to paint images of trees, houses, mountains, animals, etc. That is not creating. That is IMITATING, PHOTOGRAPHING.

Creating is not IMITATING. Creating is not PHOTOGRAPHING. To create is to translate, to transmit with the brush and the living the tree that we love, the beautiful sunset, the sunrise with its ineffable melodies, etc.etc.

There is true creation in CHINESE AND JAPANESE ZEN art, in abstract and semi-abstract art.

Any Chinese CHAN and ZEN painter is not interested in IMITATING, photographing. The painters of China and Japan: they enjoy creating and re-creating.

ZEN and CHAN painters do not imitate, they CREATE and that is their job.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN are not interested in painting or photographing a beautiful woman, they enjoy conveying her abstract beauty.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN would never imitate a beautiful sunset, they enjoy transmitting in abstract beauty all the charm of the sunset.

The important thing is not to IMITATE, to copy in black or white; the important thing is to feel the deep meaning of beauty and to know how to transmit it, but for this there needs to be no fear, no attachment to rules, to tradition, or fear of what people will say or of the teacher's scolding.

It is URGENT that teachers understand the need for students to develop creative power.

It is clearly absurd to teach students to imitate. It is better to teach them to create.

Unfortunately, the human being is an unconscious sleeping automaton, who only knows how to IMITATE.

We imitate other people's clothes and from this imitation come the different fashion trends.

We imitate the customs of others even when they are very wrong.

We imitate vices, we imitate everything that is absurd, that which is always repeating itself over time, etc.

It is necessary for school TEACHERS to teach students to think for themselves independently.

Teachers should offer students all possibilities to stop being IMITATIVE SELF-MATES.

Teachers must provide students with the best opportunities to develop creative power.

It is URGENT for students to know true freedom, so that they can fearlessly learn to think for themselves, freely.

The mind that lives as a slave to WHAT THEY SAY, the mind that IMITATES, for fear of violating traditions, rules, customs, etc., is not a creative mind. It is not a creative mind, it is not a free mind.

The mind of the people is like a house closed and sealed with seven seals, a house where nothing new can happen, a house where the sun does not enter, a house where only death and pain reign.

The NEW can only happen where there is no fear, where there is no IMITATION, where there is no attachment to things, to money, to people, to traditions, to customs, etc.

People live as slaves of intrigue, of envy, of family customs, of habits, of the insatiable desire to gain positions, to climb, to climb, to climb to the top of the ladder, to make themselves felt, etc. etc. etc.

It is URGENT that TEACHERS teach their male and female students the need not to imitate all this outdated and degenerated order of old things.

It is URGENT that PUPILS learn at school to create freely, to think freely, to feel freely.

Pupils spend the best part of their lives at school acquiring INFORMATION and yet they have no time left to think about all these things.

Ten or fifteen years in school living the life of unconscious automatons and they leave school with their consciousness asleep, but they leave school believing themselves to be very awake.

The human mind lives bottled up in conservative and reactionary ideas.

The human being cannot think with true freedom because he is full of FEAR.

The human being is FEARFUL of life, FEARFUL of death, FEARFUL of what people will say, of what people say, of gossip, of losing one's job, of violating regulations, of someone taking one's spouse or stealing one's spouse, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.

In school we are taught to IMITATE and we leave school as IMITATORS.

We have no free INITIATIVE because from the school benches we were taught to IMITATE.

People IMITATE out of fear of what other people might say, pupils IMITATE because the TEACHERS are really terrified of the poor students, they are threatened at every moment, threatened with a bad grade, threatened with certain punishments, threatened with expulsion, etc.

If we really want to become creators in the fullest sense of the word, we must become aware of the whole series of IMITATIONS that unfortunately have trapped us.

When we are able to get to know the whole series of IMITATIONS, when we have carefully analysed each of the IMITATIONS, we become aware of them and, as a logical consequence, the power to create is born in us spontaneously.

It is necessary for students at school, college or university to free themselves from all IMITATION in order to become true creators.

Teachers who wrongly assume that students need to IMITATE in order to learn are wrong. He who IMITATES does not learn, he who IMITATES becomes an AUTOMAT and that is all.

It is not a matter of IMITATING what the authors of geography, physics, arithmetic, history, etc. say. IMITATING, MEMORIZING, repeating like parrots is stupid, it is better to CONSCIOUSLY UNDERSTAND what we are studying.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is the SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, the science that allows us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things.

The mind that only knows how to IMITATE is MECHANICAL, it is a machine that works, it is NOT creative, it is not capable of creating, it does not really think, it only repeats and that is all.

Teachers must be concerned with the awakening of the CONSCIOUSNESS in each student.

Students are only concerned with passing the year and then... outside of school, in practical life, they become office workers or child-making machines.

Ten or fifteen years of studies to come out converted into talking automatons, the subjects studied are forgotten little by little and in the end nothing remains in the memory.

If students were to become AWARE of the subjects studied, if their studies were not based solely on INFORMATION, IMITATION and MEMORY, they would have a different GALLO. They would leave school with CONSCIOUS, UNFORGETTABLE, COMPLETE knowledge, which would not be subject to INFIEL MEMORY.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION will help students by awakening their CONSCIOUSNESS and INTELLIGENCE.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION leads the youth on the path of TRUE REVOLUTION.

The pupils must insist that the TEACHERS give them TRUE EDUCATION, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

It is not enough for pupils to sit on school benches to receive information about some king or some war, something more is needed, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is needed to awaken AWARENESS.

It is URGENT that pupils leave school mature, truly AWARE, INTELLIGENT, so that they do not become mere automatic cogs in the social machinery.
