It has been fully demonstrated that FEAR hinders free INITIATIVE. The poor economic situation of millions of people is undoubtedly due to what is called FEAR.

A frightened child seeks their beloved mother and clings to her for security. A frightened husband clings to his wife and feels he loves her much more. A frightened wife seeks her husband and children and feels she loves them much more.

From a psychological perspective, it is very curious and interesting to know that fear often disguises itself in the clothing of LOVE.

People who internally have very few SPIRITUAL VALUES, those who are internally poor, always seek something outside to complete themselves.

Internally poor people live always scheming, always in foolishness, gossip, bestial pleasures, etc.

Internally poor people live from fear to fear and, naturally, cling to their spouse, parents, children, old, outdated, and degenerate traditions, etc., etc., etc.

Every old, sick, and psychologically poor person is usually full of fear and clings with infinite anxiety to money, family traditions, grandchildren, memories, etc., as if seeking security. This is something we can all observe carefully in the elderly.

Whenever people are afraid, they hide behind the protective shield of RESPECTABILITY. Following a tradition, whether of race, family, nation, etc., etc., etc.

Truly, every tradition is a mere repetition without meaning, hollow, without true value.

All people have a marked tendency to IMITATE others. This IMITATION is a product of FEAR.

Fearful people IMITATE all those to whom they cling. They imitate their spouse, children, siblings, friends who protect them, etc., etc., etc.

IMITATION is the result of FEAR. IMITATION completely destroys FREE INITIATIVE.

In schools, colleges, and universities, teachers make the mistake of teaching students, both male and female, what is called IMITATION.

In painting and drawing classes, students are taught to copy, to paint images of trees, houses, mountains, animals, etc. That is not creating. That is IMITATING, PHOTOGRAPHING.

Creating is not IMITATING. Creating is not PHOTOGRAPHING. Creating is translating, transmitting with the brush and vividly the tree that enchants us, the beautiful sunset, the dawn with its ineffable melodies, etc., etc.

There is true creation in CHINESE AND JAPANESE ZEN ART, in abstract and semi-abstract art.

Any CHAN or ZEN Chinese painter is not interested in IMITATING or photographing. The painters of China and Japan enjoy creating and recreating.

ZEN and CHAN painters do not imitate, they CREATE, and that is their work.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN are not interested in painting or photographing a beautiful woman; they enjoy transmitting her abstract beauty.

The painters of CHINA and JAPAN would never imitate a beautiful sunset; they enjoy transmitting the entire charm of the sunset in abstract beauty.

What is important is not to IMITATE, to copy in black or white; what is important is to feel the deep significance of beauty and know how to transmit it, but for that, there must be no fear, no attachment to rules, tradition, or fear of what others will say or the teacher's scolding.

It is URGENT that teachers understand the need for students to develop their creative power.

It is clearly absurd to teach students to IMITATE. It is better to teach them to create.

Unfortunately, the human being is an unconscious, sleeping automaton that only knows how to IMITATE.

We imitate others' clothing, and from that imitation come the various fashion trends.

We imitate others' customs, even when they are very wrong.

We imitate vices, we imitate everything that is absurd, everything that is endlessly repeated over time, etc.

It is necessary for TEACHERS to teach students to think for themselves independently.

Teachers must offer students all the possibilities to stop being IMITATIVE AUTOMATONS.

Teachers must provide students with the best opportunities to develop their creative power.

It is URGENT that students know true freedom, so that without any fear, they can learn to think for themselves, freely.

The mind that lives enslaved by WHAT OTHERS WILL SAY, the mind that IMITATES out of fear of violating traditions, rules, customs, etc., is not a creative mind, it is not a free mind.

The mind of people is like a house closed and sealed with seven seals, a house where nothing new can happen, a house where the sun does not enter, a house where only death and pain reign.

The NEW can only occur where there is no fear, where there is no IMITATION, where there is no attachment to things, money, people, traditions, customs, etc.

People live enslaved by intrigue, envy, family customs, habits, the insatiable desire to gain positions, climb, rise, reach the top of the ladder, make themselves felt, etc., etc.

It is URGENT that TEACHERS teach their students, both male and female, the need not to IMITATE this outdated and degenerate order of old things.

It is URGENT that STUDENTS learn in school to create freely, to think freely, to feel freely.

Students spend the best part of their lives in school acquiring INFORMATION, yet they have no time to think about all these things.

Ten or fifteen years in school living the life of unconscious automatons, and they leave school with a dormant consciousness, but they leave believing they are very awake.

The human mind lives bottled up between conservative and reactionary ideas.

The human being cannot think with true freedom because they are full of FEAR.

The human being is AFRAID of life, AFRAID of death, AFRAID of what others will say, of gossip, of losing their job, of violating regulations, of someone taking their spouse or stealing their spouse, etc., etc., etc.

In school, we are taught to IMITATE, and we leave school as IMITATORS.

We do not have free INITIATIVE because from the school benches, we were taught to IMITATE.

People IMITATE out of fear of what others might say; students IMITATE because TEACHERS have truly terrified the poor students, threatening them at every moment, threatening them with bad grades, certain punishments, expulsion, etc.

If we truly want to become creators in the fullest sense of the word, we must become aware of all those IMITATIONS that unfortunately have us trapped.

When we are capable of knowing all the series of IMITATIONS, when we have carefully analyzed each of the IMITATIONS, we become aware of them, and as a logical consequence, the power to create spontaneously arises in us.

It is necessary for students in school, college, or university to free themselves from all IMITATION so that they can become true creators.

Teachers are mistaken when they wrongly assume that students need to IMITATE to learn. Those who IMITATE do not learn; those who IMITATE become AUTOMATONS, and that is all.

It is not about IMITATING what the authors of geography, physics, arithmetic, history, etc., say. IMITATING, MEMORIZING, repeating like parrots is stupid; it is better to CONSCIOUSLY UNDERSTAND what we are studying.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is the SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, the science that allows us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things.

The mind that only knows how to IMITATE is MECHANICAL, it is a functioning machine, it is NOT creative, it is not capable of creating, it does not truly think, it only repeats, and that is all.

Teachers must be concerned with awakening CONSCIOUSNESS in each student.

Students only worry about passing the year, and then... once out of school, in practical life, they become office clerks or baby-making machines.

Ten or fifteen years of study to leave as talking automatons; the subjects studied are gradually forgotten, and in the end, nothing remains in memory.

If students became CONSCIOUS of the subjects studied, if their study were not based solely on INFORMATION, IMITATION, and MEMORY, a different story would unfold. They would leave school with CONSCIOUS, UNFORGETTABLE, COMPLETE knowledge, not subject to UNRELIABLE MEMORY.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION will help students by awakening their CONSCIOUSNESS and INTELLIGENCE.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION leads young people on the path of TRUE REVOLUTION.

Students must insist that TEACHERS give them TRUE EDUCATION, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

It is not enough for students to sit on school benches to receive information about some king or some war; something more is needed, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is needed to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS.

It is URGENT that students leave school mature, truly CONSCIOUS, INTELLIGENT, so that they do not become mere automatic cogs in the social machinery.
