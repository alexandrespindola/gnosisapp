It is urgent to fully understand, in every area of the mind, what DEATH truly is, as only then is it possible to truly understand immortality in its entirety.

Seeing a loved one's human body placed in a coffin does not mean you have understood the mystery of death.

Truth is the unknown from moment to moment. The truth about death cannot be an exception.

The EGO always wants, as is only natural, death insurance, an extra guarantee, some authority to take care of ensuring us a good position and any kind of immortality beyond the terrifying tomb.

THE SELF does not really want to die. THE EGO wants to continue. THE EGO is very afraid of death.

TRUTH is not a matter of believing or doubting. Truth has nothing to do with credulity or scepticism. Truth is not a matter of ideas, theories, opinions, concepts, preconceptions, assumptions, prejudices, affirmations, negotiations, etc. The truth about the mystery of Death is not an exception.

The Truth about the mystery of death can only be known through direct experience.

It is impossible to communicate the REAL experience of death to someone who does not know it.

Any poet can write beautiful books about LOVE, but it is impossible to communicate the TRUTH about LOVE to people who have never experienced it, in a similar way we say that it is impossible to communicate the truth about death to people who have not experienced it.

Anyone who wants to know the truth about death must investigate, experience for themselves, search properly, only then can we discover the profound meaning of death.

Observation and experience of many years have allowed us to understand that people are not interested in really understanding the deep meaning of death; all people are really interested in is continuing in the afterlife and that is all.

Many people want to continue through material possessions, prestige, family, beliefs, ideas, children, etc., and when they understand that any kind of psychological continuity is vain, fleeting, ephemeral, unstable, then feeling without guarantees, insecure, they are frightened, horrified, filled with infinite terror.

The poor people do not want to understand, they do not want to understand that everything that continues unfolds in time.

The poor people do not want to understand that everything that continues decays with time.

The poor people do not want to understand that everything that continues becomes mechanistic, routine, boring.

It is urgent, it is necessary, it is indispensable, to become fully aware of the profound meaning of death, only then does the fear of ceasing to exist disappear.

Observing humanity carefully, we can verify that the mind is always bottled up in the known and wants that which is known to continue beyond the grave.

The mind bottled up in the known can never experience the unknown, the real, the true.

Only by breaking the bottle of time through correct meditation can we experience the ETERNAL, the TIMELESS, the REAL.

Those who wish to continue fear death, and their beliefs and theories only serve as a narcotic.

Death in itself has nothing terrifying, it is something very beautiful, sublime, ineffable, but the mind bottled up in the known only moves within the vicious circle that goes from credulity to scepticism.

When we really become fully aware of the deep and profound meaning of death, we then discover for ourselves through direct experience that Life and Death constitute an integral, uni-total whole.

Death is the repository of Life. The path of Life is formed with the hoofprints of death.

Life is determined and determining Energy. From birth to death, different types of energy flow within the human organism.

The only type of energy that the human organism cannot resist is the RAY OF DEATH. This ray possesses an electrical voltage that is too high. The human organism cannot resist such a voltage.

Just as a lightning bolt can shatter a tree, so too does the ray of death destroy the human organism inevitably as it flows through it.

The ray of death connects the death phenomenon with the birth phenomenon.

The ray of death originates very intimate electrical tensions and a certain key note that has the power, determining the combination of genes within the fertilised egg.

The ray of death reduces the human organism to its fundamental elements.

The EGO, the energetic SELF, unfortunately continues in our descendants.

What is the Truth about death, what is the interval between death and conception is something that does not belong to time and that only through the science of meditation can we experience.

The Masters of Schools, Colleges and Universities, must teach their pupils the path that leads to the experience of the REAL, of the TRUE.
