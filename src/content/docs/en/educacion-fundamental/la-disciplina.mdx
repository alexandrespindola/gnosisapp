School, college, and university teachers place a great deal of importance on discipline, and we must study it in this chapter carefully.

All of us who have been through schools, colleges, universities, etc. know very well what disciplines, rules, canes, scoldings, etc., etc., etc. are.

Discipline is what is called CULTIVATION OF RESISTANCE. School teachers love to cultivate RESISTANCE.

We are taught to resist, to erect something against something else. We are taught to resist the temptations of the flesh, and we whip ourselves and do penance to resist.

We are taught to RESIST the temptations that laziness brings, temptations not to study, not to go to school, to play, to laugh, to make fun of teachers, to violate regulations, etc. etc. etc.

Teachers have the mistaken concept that through discipline we can understand the need to respect the order of the school, the need to study, to maintain composure before teachers, to behave well with fellow students, etc. etc. etc.

There is a misconception among people that the more we resist, the more we reject, the more and more understanding, free, full, victorious we become.

People don't want to realise that the more we fight against something, the more we resist it, the more we reject it, the less UNDERSTANDING there is.

If we fight against the vice of drinking, it will disappear for a time, but since we have not COMPREHENDED it thoroughly at all LEVELS OF THE MIND, it will return later when we neglect our guard, and we will drink all at once for the whole year.

If we reject the vice of fornication, for a time we will be very chaste in appearance (even though in other LEVELS OF THE MIND we continue to be appalling SATYRS as EROTIC dreams and nocturnal pollutions can demonstrate), and afterwards we will return with more force to our old ways of UNREDEEMED FORNICATORS, due to the concrete fact of not having thoroughly understood what FORNICATION is.

Many are those who reject GREED, those who fight against it, those who discipline themselves against it following certain RULES of conduct, but since they have not truly understood the whole process of GREED, they end up at heart COVETING not to be COVETOUS.

Many are those who discipline themselves against WRATH, those who learn to resist it, but it continues to exist in other levels of the subconscious mind, even though in appearance it has disappeared from our character, and at the slightest lapse of guard, the subconscious betrays us, and then we thunder and lightning full of wrath, when we least expected it and perhaps for some reason that is of NO IMPORTANCE.

Many are those who discipline themselves against jealousy and finally firmly believe that they have already extinguished it, but since they did not understand it, it is clear that these reappear on the scene precisely when we already believed them to be well dead.

Only with full absence of disciplines, only in authentic freedom, does the ardent flame of UNDERSTANDING arise in the mind.

CREATIVE FREEDOM can never exist in a FRAMEWORK. We need freedom to UNDERSTAND our PSYCHOLOGICAL defects in an INTEGRAL way.

We URGENTLY need to tear down walls and break steel shackles, to be free.

We have to experience for ourselves everything that our Teachers in School and our Parents have told us is good and useful. It is not enough to learn by heart and imitate. We need to understand.

All the effort of the Teachers should be directed to the awareness of the students. They should strive for them to enter the path of UNDERSTANDING.

It is not enough to tell students that they should be this or that, it is necessary that students learn to be free so that they can examine, study, analyse all the values, all the things that people have said are beneficial, useful, noble and not merely accept and imitate them.

People don't want to discover for themselves, they have closed, stupid minds, minds that don't want to investigate, mechanistic minds that never investigate and only IMITATE.

It is necessary, it is urgent, it is indispensable that students from their earliest age until the moment of leaving the CLASSROOMS enjoy true freedom to discover for themselves, to inquire, to understand and that they are not limited by the abject walls of prohibitions, scoldings and disciplines.

If students are told what they should and should not do and are not allowed to UNDERSTAND and experience, WHERE then is their intelligence? WHAT is the opportunity that has been given to intelligence?

What is the point of taking exams, dressing very well, having many friends if we are not intelligent?

Intelligence only comes to us when we are truly free to investigate for ourselves, to understand, to analyse without the fear of scolding and without the cane of Disciplines.

Fearful, frightened students, subjected to terrible disciplines can never KNOW. They can never be intelligent.

Nowadays, all that the Parents and Teachers are interested in is that the students pursue a career, that they become doctors, lawyers, engineers, office workers, that is to say, living automatons and that they then marry and also become BABY-MAKING MACHINES and that's all.

When the boys or girls want to do something new, something different, when they feel the need to get out of that framework, prejudices, outdated habits, disciplines, family or national traditions, etc., then the parents tighten the shackles of the prison and say to the boy or girl: Don't do that! we are not willing to support you in that, those things are crazy, etc., etc., etc.

IN TOTAL, the boy or girl is formally imprisoned within the prison of disciplines, traditions, outdated customs, decrepit ideas, etc.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION teaches to reconcile ORDER with FREEDOM.

ORDER without FREEDOM is TYRANNY. FREEDOM without ORDER is ANARCHY.

FREEDOM AND ORDER wisely combined constitute the BASIS of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

STUDENTS must enjoy perfect freedom to find out for themselves, to INQUIRE, to DISCOVER what they really, what they certainly are in THEMSELVES and what they can do in life.

Students, soldiers and policemen and in general all those people who have to live subjected to rigorous disciplines, tend to become cruel, insensitive to human pain, ruthless.

DISCIPLINE destroys human SENSITIVITY and this is already fully demonstrated by OBSERVATION and EXPERIENCE.

Due to so many disciplines and regulations, the people of this era have completely lost SENSITIVITY and have become cruel and ruthless.

To be truly free you need to be very sensitive and humanistic.

In schools, colleges and universities, students are taught to pay ATTENTION in classes and students pay attention to avoid scolding, ear pulling, being hit with the cane or ruler, etc. etc. etc. But unfortunately they are not taught to REALLY UNDERSTAND what CONSCIOUS ATTENTION is.

By discipline the student pays attention and spends creative energy many times uselessly.

Creative energy is the most subtle type of force manufactured by the ORGANIC MACHINE.

We eat and drink and all the processes of digestion are basically processes of subtilisation in which coarse matter is converted into useful matter and forces.

Creative energy is: the most subtle type of MATTER and FORCE elaborated by the organism.

If we know how to pay CONSCIOUS ATTENTION, we can save creative energy.

Unfortunately, teachers do not teach their disciples what CONSCIOUS ATTENTION is.

Wherever we direct our ATTENTION, we spend CREATIVE ENERGY. We can save that energy if we divide our attention, if we do not identify ourselves with things, with people, with ideas.

When we identify ourselves with people, with things, with ideas, we forget ourselves and then we lose CREATIVE ENERGY in the most pitiful way.

It is URGENT to know that we need to save CREATIVE ENERGY to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS and that CREATIVE ENERGY is the LIVING POTENTIAL, the VEHICLE of CONSCIOUSNESS, the instrument to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS.

When we learn NOT to forget OURSELVES, when we learn to divide the ATTENTION between SUBJECT; OBJECT and PLACE, we save CREATIVE ENERGY to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS.

It is necessary to learn how to manage ATTENTION to awaken consciousness, but students know nothing about this because their TEACHERS have not taught them.

WHEN we learn to use ATTENTION consciously, discipline is then unnecessary.

The student who is attentive to his classes, to his lessons, to order, does NOT need discipline of any kind.

It is URGENT that TEACHERS understand the need to intelligently reconcile FREEDOM and ORDER and this is possible through CONSCIOUS ATTENTION.

CONSCIOUS ATTENTION excludes what is called IDENTIFICATION. When we IDENTIFY with people, with things, with ideas, FASCINATION comes and the latter produces SLEEP in the CONSCIOUSNESS.

You have to know how to pay ATTENTION without IDENTIFICATION. WHEN we pay attention to something or someone and we forget ourselves, the result is FASCINATION and the SLEEP of CONSCIOUSNESS.

Carefully observe a CINEMA-GOER. He is asleep, he ignores everything, he ignores himself, he is empty, he seems like a sleepwalker, he dreams with the film he is watching, with the hero of the film.

STUDENTS must pay attention in classes without forgetting THEMSELVES so as not to fall into the HORRIBLE SLEEP of CONSCIOUSNESS.

The student must see himself on stage when he is presenting an exam or when he is in front of the board or blackboard by order of the teacher, or when he is studying or resting or playing with his fellow students.

The ATTENTION DIVIDED into THREE PARTS: SUBJECT, OBJECT, PLACE, is in fact CONSCIOUS ATTENTION.

When we do not make the ERROR of IDENTIFYING with people, things, ideas, etc. we save CREATIVE ENERGY and precipitate in us the awakening of CONSCIOUSNESS.

Whoever wants to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS in the SUPERIOR WORLDS, must start by AWAKENING here and now.

When the STUDENT makes the mistake of IDENTIFYING with people, things, ideas, when he makes the mistake of forgetting himself, then he falls into fascination and sleep.

Discipline does not teach students to pay CONSCIOUS ATTENTION. Discipline is a real prison for the mind.

Students must learn to manage CONSCIOUS ATTENTION from the same school benches so that later in practical life, outside of school, they do not make the mistake of forgetting themselves.

The man who forgets himself before an insulter, identifies with him, is fascinated, falls into the sleep of unconsciousness and then hurts or kills and inevitably goes to jail.

He who does not let himself be FASCINATED with the insulter, he who does not identify with him, he who does not forget himself, he who knows how to pay CONSCIOUS ATTENTION, would be unable to give value to the words of the insulter, or to hurt or kill him.

All the mistakes that the human being makes in life are due to the fact that he forgets himself, identifies, is fascinated and falls asleep.

It would be better for youth, for all students, if they were taught the AWAKENING of CONSCIOUSNESS instead of enslaving them with so many absurd disciplines.
