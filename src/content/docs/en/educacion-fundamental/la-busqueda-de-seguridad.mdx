When chicks are scared, they hide under the hen's loving wings for safety.

The frightened child runs to his mother because he feels safe with her.

It is therefore demonstrated that FEAR and the search for SAFETY are always intimately associated.

The man who fears being assaulted by bandits seeks safety in his gun.

The country that fears being attacked by another country will buy cannons, airplanes, warships, and arm armies and prepare for war.

Many subjects who do not know how to work, terrified by misery, seek safety in crime and become thieves, robbers, etc...

Many women lacking intelligence, frightened by the possibility of misery, become prostitutes.

The jealous man fears losing his wife and seeks safety in a gun, kills, and then it is clear that he will end up in jail.

The jealous woman kills her rival or her husband and thus becomes a murderer.

She fears losing her husband and, wanting to secure him, kills the other woman or decides to murder him.

The fearful landlord, afraid that people will not pay the rent of the house, demands contracts, guarantors, deposits, etc., wanting to ensure himself, and if a poor widow full of children cannot fulfill such tremendous requirements, and if all the landlords of a city do the same, in the end the unfortunate woman will have to go to sleep with her children in the street or in the parks of the city.

All wars originate in fear.

The Gestapos, the tortures, the concentration camps, the Siberias, the dreadful prisons, exiles, forced labor, executions, etc. originate in fear.

Nations attack other nations out of fear; they seek security in violence, they believe that by killing, invading, etc. they can make themselves secure, strong, powerful.

In the offices of secret police, counter-espionage, etc. both in the East and in the West, spies are tortured, they are feared, they want to make them confess with the purpose of finding security for the State.

All crimes, all wars, all atrocities, originate in fear and the search for security.

In other times there was sincerity among people, today fear and the search for security have destroyed the wonderful fragrance of sincerity.

The friend distrusts the friend, he fears that he will steal from him, swindle him, exploit him and there are even stupid and perverse maxims like this: "NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR BEST FRIEND". The HITLERIANS said that this MAXIM was GOLDEN.

Now the friend fears the friend and even uses MAXIMS to protect himself. There is no longer sincerity between friends. Fear and the search for security destroyed the delicious fragrance of sincerity.

Castro Rus in Cuba has shot thousands of citizens for fear that they will finish him; Castro seeks security by shooting. He believes that he can find Security in this way.

Stalin, the perverse and bloodthirsty Stalin, plagued Russia with his bloody purges. That was the way to seek his security.

Hitler organized the Gestapo, the terrible Gestapo, for the security of the State. There is no doubt that he feared being overthrown and for that reason he founded the bloody Gestapo.

All the bitterness of this world originates in fear and the search for security.

School teachers should teach students the virtue of courage.

It is regrettable that children are filled with fear from their own home.

Children are threatened, intimidated, frightened, beaten, etc.

It is customary for parents and teachers to frighten the child and the young person for the purpose of studying.

Usually children and young people are told that if they do not study they will have to beg, wander hungry through the streets, perform very humble jobs such as cleaning shoes, carrying bundles, selling newspapers, working in plowing, etc. etc. etc. (As if work were a crime)

Deep down, behind all these words of parents and teachers, there is fear for the child and the search for security for the child.

The serious thing about everything we are saying is that the child and the young person become self-conscious, filled with fear and later in practical life they are subjects full of fear.

Parents and teachers who have the bad taste to scare children, young people, unconsciously are leading them down the path of crime, because as we already said, all crime has its origin in fear and the search for security.

Today FEAR and the SEARCH FOR SECURITY have turned planet earth into a frightening hell. Everyone is afraid. Everyone wants security.

In other times you could travel freely, now the borders are full of armed guards, passports and certificates of all kinds are required to have the right to pass from one country to another.

All this is the result of fear and SEARCH FOR SECURITY. They fear the one who travels, they fear the one who arrives and they seek security in passports and papers of all kinds.

School teachers, colleges, universities should understand the horror of all this and cooperate for the good of the world, knowing how to educate the new generations, teaching them the path of authentic courage.

It is URGENT to teach the new generations not to fear and not to seek security in anything or anyone.

It is essential that every individual learn to trust more in himself.

FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY are terrible weaknesses that turned life into a frightening HELL.

Cowards, fearful people, weak people who are always looking for SECURITY abound everywhere.

They fear life, they fear death, they fear what they will say, "what is said to be said", losing social position, political position, prestige, money, the beautiful house, the beautiful woman, the good husband, the job, the business, the monopoly, the furniture, the car, etc. etc. etc. everything is feared, cowards, fearful people, weak people abound everywhere, but no one believes themselves to be a coward, everyone presumes to be strong, courageous, etc.

In all social classes there are thousands and millions of interests that they fear losing and therefore everyone seeks security that, by becoming more and more complex, makes life in fact more complicated, more difficult, more bitter, cruel and ruthless.

All the murmurings, all the slanders, intrigues, etc., originate in fear and the search for security.

In order not to lose fortune, position, power, prestige, slanders, gossip are spread, one is murdered, one pays to be murdered in secret, etc.

The powerful of the earth even give themselves the luxury of having hired assassins and very well paid, with the disgusting purpose of eliminating anyone who threatens to eclipse them.

They love power for power itself and secure it based on money and much blood.

Newspapers are constantly giving news of many cases of suicide.

Many believe that the one who commits suicide is courageous, but really the one who commits suicide is a coward who is afraid of life and who seeks security in the bony arms of death.

Some war heroes were known as weak and cowardly people, but when they came face to face with death, their terror was so frightening that they turned into terrible beasts seeking security for their life, making a supreme effort against death. Then they were declared HEROES.

Fear is often confused with courage. He who commits suicide seems very courageous, he who carries a gun seems very courageous, but in reality suicides and gunmen are very cowardly.

He who is not afraid of life does not commit suicide. He who is not afraid of anyone does not carry a gun on his belt.

It is URGENT that school teachers teach the citizen in a clear and precise way what TRUE COURAGE is and what fear is.

FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY have turned the world into a frightening hell.
