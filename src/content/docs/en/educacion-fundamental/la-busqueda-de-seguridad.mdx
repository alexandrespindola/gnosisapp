When chicks are scared, they hide under the hen's loving wings for safety.

The frightened child runs to their mother because they feel safe with her.

It is therefore demonstrated that FEAR and the search for SECURITY are always intimately associated.

The man who fears being assaulted by bandits seeks security in his gun.

The country that fears being attacked by another country will buy cannons, aeroplanes, warships and arm armies and prepare for war.

Many subjects who do not know how to work, terrified of misery, seek security in crime, and become thieves, assailants, etc...

Many unintelligent women, frightened by the possibility of misery, become prostitutes.

The jealous man fears losing his wife and seeks security in a gun, kills, and then it is clear that he will end up in jail.

The jealous woman kills her rival or her husband and thus becomes a murderer.

She fears losing her husband and, wanting to secure him, kills the other woman or resolves to murder him.

The landlord, fearful that people will not pay the rent for the house, demands contracts, guarantors, deposits, etc., wanting to ensure himself, and if a poor widow full of children cannot fulfil such tremendous requirements, and if all the landlords in a city do the same, in the end the unfortunate woman will have to go to sleep with her children in the street or in the city's parks.

All wars originate in fear.

The Gestapos, the tortures, the concentration camps, the Siberias, the horrifying prisons, exiles, forced labour, shootings, etc. have their origin in fear.

Nations attack other nations out of fear; they seek security in violence, they believe that by killing, invading, etc. they can become safe, strong, powerful.

In the offices of secret police, counter-espionage, etc. both in the east and in the west, spies are tortured, they are feared, they want to make them confess with the purpose of finding security for the State.

All crimes, all wars, all murders, have their origin in fear and the search for security.

In other times there was sincerity between people, today fear and the search for security have ended the wonderful fragrance of sincerity.

The friend distrusts the friend, fears that they will steal from them, swindle them, exploit them and there are even stupid and perverse maxims like this: "NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR BEST FRIEND". The HITLERIANS said that this MAXIM was GOLDEN.

Now the friend fears the friend and even uses MAXIMS to protect themselves. There is no longer sincerity between friends. Fear and the search for security ended the delicious fragrance of sincerity.

Castro Rus in Cuba has shot thousands of citizens fearful that they will finish him off; Castro seeks security by shooting. He believes that this is how he can find Security.

Stalin, the perverse and bloody Stalin, fouled Russia with his bloody purges. That was his way of seeking his security.

Hitler organised the Gestapo, the terrible Gestapo, for the security of the State. There is no doubt that he feared being overthrown and that is why he founded the bloody Gestapo.

All the bitterness of this world has its origin in fear and the search for security.

School teachers must teach students the virtue of courage.

It is regrettable that children are filled with fear from their very home.

Children are threatened, intimidated, frightened, beaten, etc.

It is customary for parents and teachers to frighten children and young people for the purpose of making them study.

Children and young people are usually told that if they do not study they will have to beg, wander hungry through the streets, perform very humble jobs such as cleaning shoes, carrying bundles, selling newspapers, working in the plough, etc. etc. etc. (As if work were a crime)

Deep down, behind all these words from parents and teachers, there is fear for the child and a search for security for the child.

The serious thing about all this that we are saying is that the child and the young person become self-conscious, become full of fear and later in practical life they are subjects full of fear.

Parents and teachers who have the bad taste to scare children, young people and young ladies, are unconsciously leading them down the path of crime, because as we have already said, every crime has its origin in fear and the search for security.

Today, FEAR and the SEARCH FOR SECURITY have turned planet Earth into a frightening hell. Everyone is afraid. Everyone wants security.

In other times it was possible to travel freely, now the borders are full of armed guards, passports and certificates of all kinds are required to have the right to pass from one country to another.

All this is the result of fear and SEARCH FOR SECURITY. They fear the traveller, they fear the newcomer and they seek security in passports and papers of all kinds.

Teachers in schools, colleges, universities must understand the horror of all this and cooperate for the good of the world, knowing how to educate the new generations, teaching them the path of authentic courage.

It is URGENT to teach the new generations not to fear and not to seek security in anything or anyone.

It is essential that every individual learns to trust more in themselves.

FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY are terrible weaknesses that turned life into a frightening HELL.

Cowards, fearful people, weak people who are always looking for SECURITY abound everywhere.

They fear life, they fear death, they fear what they will say, "what is said that is said", losing social position, political position, prestige, money, the beautiful house, the beautiful woman, the good husband, the job, the business, the monopoly, the furniture, the car, etc. etc. etc. everything is feared, cowards, fearful people, weak people abound everywhere, but no one believes themselves to be cowardly, everyone presumes to be strong, courageous, etc.

In all social classes there are thousands and millions of interests that they fear losing and therefore everyone seeks securities that, by becoming more and more complex, in fact make life increasingly complicated, increasingly difficult, increasingly bitter, cruel and ruthless.

All murmuring, all slander, intrigues, etc., have their origin in fear and the search for security.

In order not to lose fortune, position, power, prestige, slanders and gossip are spread, murders are committed, payment is made for murders to be committed in secret, etc.

The powerful of the earth even give themselves the luxury of having hired and well-paid assassins, with the disgusting purpose of eliminating anyone who threatens to eclipse them.

They love power for power itself and secure it on the basis of money and much blood.

Newspapers are constantly reporting many cases of suicide.

Many believe that the person who commits suicide is courageous, but in reality the person who commits suicide is a coward who is afraid of life and who seeks security in the gaunt arms of death.

Some war heroes were known as weak and cowardly people, but when they came face to face with death, their terror was so frightening that they turned into terrible beasts seeking security for their lives, making a supreme effort against death. Then they were declared HEROES.

Fear is often confused with courage. The person who commits suicide seems very courageous, the person who carries a gun seems very courageous, but in reality suicides and gunmen are very cowardly.

The person who is not afraid of life does not commit suicide. The person who is not afraid of anyone does not carry a gun on their belt.

It is URGENT that school teachers teach citizens clearly and precisely what TRUE COURAGE is and what fear is.

FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY have turned the world into a frightening hell.
