To remember is to try to store in the Mind what we have seen and heard, what we have read, what other people have told us, what has happened to us, etc. etc. etc.

Teachers want their students to store in their memory their words, their phrases, what is written in school texts, entire chapters, overwhelming tasks, with all their periods and commas, etc.

Passing exams means recalling what we have been told, what we have read mechanically, verbalizing memory, repeating like parrots, macaws or parakeets, everything that we have stored in memory.

It is necessary for the new generation to understand that repeating like a Radioconsola record all the recordings made in the memory does not mean having fully understood. Remembering is not understanding, it is useless to remember without understanding, the memory belongs to the past, it is something dead, something that no longer has life.

It is indispensable, urgent and of palpitating current relevance that all students in schools, colleges and universities really understand the deep meaning of profound understanding.

UNDERSTANDING is something immediate, direct, something that we experience intensely, something that we experience very deeply and that inevitably becomes the true intimate SPRING of conscious action.

Remembering, recalling is something dead, it belongs to the past and unfortunately it becomes an ideal, a motto, an idea, an idealism that we want to imitate mechanically and follow unconsciously.

In TRUE UNDERSTANDING, in profound understanding, in intimate understanding of the background there is only intimate pressure of consciousness, constant pressure born from the essence that we carry within and that is all.

Authentic understanding manifests itself as spontaneous, natural, simple action, free from the depressing process of choice; pure without indecision of any kind. UNDERSTANDING converted into a SECRET SPRING of action is formidable, wonderful, edifying and essentially dignifying.

Action based on the recollection of what we have read, of the ideal to which we aspire, of the norm, of conduct that we have been taught, of the experiences accumulated in memory, etc., is calculating, depends on the depressing option, is dualistic, is based on conceptual choice and only leads inevitably to error and pain.

That of accommodating the action to the recollection, that of trying to modify the action so that it coincides with the memories accumulated in the memory, is something artificial, absurd without spontaneity and that inevitably can only lead us to error and pain.

That of passing exams, that of passing a year, is done by any fool who has a good dose of cunning and memory.

Understanding the subjects that have been studied and in which we are going to be examined is something very different, it has nothing to do with memory, it belongs to true intelligence that should not be confused with intellectualism.

Those people who want to base all the acts of their life on the ideals, theories and memories of all kinds accumulated in the warehouses of memory, are always going from comparison to comparison and where there is comparison there is also envy. These people compare their persons, their relatives, their children with the children of the neighbor, with the neighboring people. They compare their house, their furniture, their clothes, all their things, with the things of the neighbor or of the neighbors or of their fellow man. They compare their ideas, the intelligence of their children with the ideas of other people, with the intelligence of other people and envy comes which then becomes the secret spring of action.

To the misfortune of the world all the mechanism of society is based on envy and the acquisitive spirit. Everyone envies everyone. We envy ideas, things, people and we want to acquire money and more money, new theories, new ideas that we accumulate in memory, new things to dazzle our fellow men, etc.

In TRUE, legitimate, authentic UNDERSTANDING, there is true love and not mere verbalization of memory.

The things that are remembered, that which is entrusted to memory, soon falls into oblivion because memory is unfaithful. Students deposit in the warehouses of memory, ideals, theories, complete texts that are useless in practical life because they eventually disappear from memory without leaving a trace.

People who only live reading and reading mechanically, people who enjoy storing theories among the warehouses of memory destroy the mind, damage it miserably.

We do not pronounce ourselves against true deep and conscious study based on deep understanding. We only condemn the antiquated methods of extemporaneous pedagogy. We condemn any mechanical system of study, any memorization, etc. Remembrance is superfluous where there is true understanding.

We need to study, useful books are needed, school, college, and university teachers are needed. The GURU, the spiritual guides, mahatmas, etc. are needed, but it is necessary to understand the teachings in an integral way and not merely deposit them among the warehouses of unfaithful memory.

We can never be truly free as long as we have the bad taste to compare ourselves with the accumulated memory, with the ideal, with what we aspire to be and are not, etc. etc.

When we truly understand the teachings received, we do not need to remember them in memory, nor turn them into ideals.

Where there is comparison of what we are here and now with what we want to become later, where there is comparison of our practical life with the ideal or model to which we want to accommodate ourselves, there can be no true love.

All comparison is abominable, all comparison brings fear, envy, pride, etc. Fear of not achieving what we want, envy for the progress of others, pride because we believe we are superior to others. The important thing in the practical life in which we live, whether we are ugly, envious, selfish, greedy, etc., is not to presume to be saints, to start from absolute zero, and to understand ourselves deeply, as we really are here and now and not as we want to become or as we presume to be.

It is impossible to dissolve the I, the MYSELF, if we do not learn to observe ourselves, to perceive in order to understand what we really are here and now in an effective and absolutely practical way.

If we really want to understand, we must listen to our teachers, gurus, priests, preceptors, spiritual guides, etc., etc.

The boys and girls of the new wave have lost the sense of respect, of veneration for our parents, teachers, spiritual guides, gurus, mahatmas, etc.

It is impossible to understand the teachings when we do not know how to venerate and respect our parents, teachers, preceptors or spiritual guides.

The simple mechanical recollection of what we have learned only by rote without deep understanding, mutates the mind and the heart and engenders envy, fear, pride, etc.

When we truly know how to listen in a conscious and profound way, a wonderful power arises within us, a formidable understanding, natural, simple, free from all mechanical processes, free from all cerebration, free from all recollection.

If the student's brain is relieved of the enormous effort of memory that must be made, it will be fully possible to teach the structure of the nucleus and the periodic table of the elements to secondary school students and to make a high school graduate understand relativity and Quanta.

As we have talked with some secondary school teachers, we understand that they cling with true fanaticism to the old antiquated and extemporaneous pedagogy. They want the students to learn everything by heart even if they do not understand it.

Sometimes they accept that it is better to understand than to memorize, but then they insist that the formulas of physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc. must be recorded in memory.

It is clear that this concept is false because when a formula of physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc., is duly understood not only at the intellectual level, but also at the other levels of the mind such as the unconscious, subconscious, infraconscious etc. etc. etc. It does not need to be recorded in memory, it becomes part of our psyche and can manifest itself as immediate instinctive knowledge when life circumstances require it.

This INTEGRAL knowledge comes to give us a form of OMNISCIENCE, a mode of conscious objective manifestation.

Deep understanding at all levels of the mind is only possible through deep introspective meditation.
