From childhood and youth, the Via Crucis of our miserable existence begins with many mental twists, intimate family tragedies, setbacks at home and at school, etc.

It is clear that in childhood and youth, with very rare exceptions, all these problems do not deeply affect us, but when we become adults, the questions begin: Who am I? Where do I come from? Why do I have to suffer? What is the object of this existence? etc. etc. etc.

We have all asked ourselves these questions on the path of life, we have all at some time wanted to investigate, inquire, to know the "why" of so many bitternesses, disappointments, struggles and sufferings, but unfortunately we always end up bottled in some theory, in some opinion, in some belief in what the neighbour said, in what some decrepit old man answered us, etc.

We have lost true innocence and the peace of a tranquil heart and therefore we are not able to experience the truth directly in all its rawness, we depend on what others say and it is clear that we are going down the wrong path.

Capitalist society radically condemns atheists, those who do not believe in God.

Marxist-Leninist society condemns those who DO believe in GOD, but deep down both things are the same, a matter of opinions, whims of people, projections of the mind. Neither credulity, nor incredulity, nor scepticism, mean having experienced the truth.

The mind can afford to believe, doubt, opine, make conjectures, etc., but that is not experiencing the truth.

We can also afford to believe in the sun or not believe in it and even doubt it, but the king star will continue to give light and life to all that exists without our opinions having the slightest importance for it.

Behind blind belief, behind incredulity and scepticism, many nuances of false morality and many mistaken concepts of false respectability are hidden, in whose shadow the EGO is strengthened.

Capitalist-type society and communist-type society each have, in their own way and according to their whims, prejudices and theories, their special type of morality. What is moral within the capitalist bloc is immoral within the communist bloc and vice versa.

Morality depends on customs, place, time. What is moral in one country is immoral in another country and what was moral in one era is immoral in another era. Morality has no essential value, analysing it in depth, it is one hundred percent stupid.

Fundamental education does not teach morality, fundamental education teaches REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS and that is what the new generations need.

From the terrifying night of the centuries, in all times, there have always been men who moved away from the world to seek the TRUTH.

It is absurd to move away from the world to seek the TRUTH because it is found within the world and within man here and now.

The TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment and it is not by separating ourselves from the world or abandoning our fellow men that we can discover it.

It is absurd to say that all truth is half truth and that all truth is half error.

The TRUTH is radical and IT IS or IT IS NOT, it can never be halfway, it can never be half error.

It is absurd to say: the TRUTH is of time and that what was in one time is not in another time.

The TRUTH has nothing to do with time. The TRUTH is TIMELESS. The EGO is time and therefore cannot know the TRUTH.

It is absurd to suppose conventional, temporary, relative truths. People confuse concepts and opinions with that which is the TRUTH.

The TRUTH has nothing to do with opinions or with so-called conventional truths, because these are only inconsequential projections of the mind.

The TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment and can only be experienced in the absence of the psychological EGO.

Truth is not a question of sophisms, concepts, opinions. Truth can only be known through direct experience.

The mind can only opine and opinions have nothing to do with the truth.

The mind can never conceive the TRUTH.

Teachers in schools, colleges, universities, must experience the truth and point the way to their disciples.

The TRUTH is a matter of direct experience, not a matter of theories, opinions or concepts.

We can and should study but it is urgent to experience for ourselves and directly what truth there may be in each theory, concept, opinion, etc. etc. etc.

We must study, analyse, inquire, but we also urgently need to experience the TRUTH contained in everything we study.

It is impossible to experience the TRUTH while the mind is agitated, convulsed, tormented by conflicting opinions.

It is only possible to experience the TRUTH when the mind is still, when the mind is silent.

Teachers in schools, colleges and universities, must show students the path of deep inner meditation.

The path of deep inner meditation leads us to the stillness and silence of the mind.

When the mind is still, empty of thoughts, desires, opinions, etc., when the mind is silent, the truth comes to us.
