Millions of students from all countries of the world go to school and university every day in an unconscious, automatic, subjective way, without knowing why, or what for.

The students are forced to study Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, etc.

Students' minds are receiving daily information but they never stop for a moment to think about the why of that information, the objective of that information. 

Why do we fill ourselves with that information? what do we fill ourselves with that information for?

Students really live a mechanistic life and only know that they have to receive intellectual information and keep it stored in their unfaithful memory, that's all.

It never occurs to students to think about what this education really is, they go to school, college or university because their parents send them and that's all.

Neither students nor teachers ever think to ask themselves: Why am I here? Why did I come here? What is the real secret motive that brings me here?

Teachers, male and female students live with their conscience asleep, they act like real automatons, they go to school, college and university in an unconscious, subjective way, without really knowing anything about why, or what for.

It is necessary to stop being automatons, to awaken consciousness, to discover for themselves what is this terrible struggle to pass exams, to study, to live in a certain place to study daily and spend the year and suffer scares, anguish, worries, practice sports, fight with schoolmates, etc., etc., etc.

Teachers must become more conscious in order to cooperate from school, college or university in helping students to awaken consciousness.

It is unfortunate to see so many SELFISH people sitting on the benches of schools, colleges and universities, receiving information that they have to keep in their memory without knowing why or what for.

The boys are only concerned with passing the year; they have been told that they must prepare themselves to earn a living, to get jobs, etc. And they study, forming a thousand fantasies in their minds about the future, without really knowing the present, without knowing the real reason why they should study physics, chemistry, biology, arithmetic, geography, etc.

Modern girls study in order to be prepared to get a good husband, or to earn a living and to be properly prepared in case their husbands leave them, or they become widows or old maids.

Pure fantasies in their minds because they don't really know what their future will be or at what age they will die.

Life at school is very vague, very incoherent, very subjective, the child is sometimes made to learn certain subjects which in practical life are of no use.

Nowadays the important thing in school is to pass the year and that's all.

In the old days there was at least a little more ethics in the passing of the year. Now there is no such ETHICS. Parents can secretly bribe the teacher and the boy or girl, even if he or she is a lousy student, will INEVITABLY pass the year.

The girls at school usually beard the teacher with the purpose of PASSING THE YEAR and the result is usually marvellous, even if they have not understood even ‘J’ of what the teacher teaches, they still do well in the EXAMS and pass the year.

There are boys and girls who are very clever at passing the year. This is a matter of cunning in many cases.

A boy who passes a certain exam (some stupid exam) victoriously does not mean that he has a true objective awareness of the subject in which he was tested.

The student repeats like a parrot, parrot or parrot and in a mechanical way that subject he studied and in which he was examined.

That is not being SELF-CONSCIOUS of that subject, that is memorising and repeating like parrots or parrots what we have learnt and that is all.

Passing exams, passing a year, does not mean BEING VERY INTELLIGENT. In practical life we have known very intelligent people who never did well in exams at school. We have known magnificent writers and great mathematicians who were lousy students at school and who never passed their exams in grammar and mathematics.

We know of one student who was a lousy student in ANATOMY and only after much suffering was able to do well in the ANATOMY exams. Today this student is the author of a great work on ANATOMY.

Passing a year does not necessarily mean being very intelligent. There are people who have never passed a year and who are very intelligent.

There is something more important than passing a year, there is something more important than studying certain subjects, and that is precisely to have a clear and bright OBJECTIVE awareness of the subjects one is studying.

Teachers must strive to help students to awaken consciousness; the whole effort of the teachers must be directed to the consciousness of the students. It is URGENT that students become fully SELF-CONSCIOUS of those subjects they study.

Learning by rote, learning like parrots, is simply STUPID in the fullest sense of the word.

Students are forced to study difficult subjects and store them in their memory to ‘PASS YEAR’ and then in practical life these subjects are not only useless but also forgotten because the memory is unfaithful.

The boys study with the purpose of getting a job and earning a living and later if they are lucky to get such a job, if they become professionals, doctors, lawyers, etc., the only thing they get is to repeat the same old story, they get married, suffer, have children and die without having awakened consciousness, they die without having had consciousness of their own life. That is all.

The girls get married, form their homes, have children, fight with their neighbours, with their husbands, with their children, divorce and remarry, become widowed, get old, etc. and finally die after having lived DORMANT, UNCONSCIOUSLY, repeating as always the same PAINFUL DRAMA of existence.

School TEACHERS do not want to realise that all human beings have a sleeping conscience. It is urgent that school teachers also wake up so that they can wake up the students.

It is no use filling our heads with theories and more theories and quoting Dante, Homer, Virgil, etc., if our conscience is asleep, if we do not have an objective, clear and perfect conscience about ourselves, about the subjects we study, about practical life.

What is the use of education if we do not become creators, conscious, truly intelligent?

Real education does not consist in knowing how to read and write. Any fool, any fool can know how to read and write.

We need to be INTELLIGENT and INTELLIGENCE only awakens in us when CONSCIOUSNESS awakens.

Humanity has ninety-seven percent SUBCONSCIOUSNESS and three percent CONSCIOUSNESS.

We need to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS, we need to convert SUBCONSCIOUSNESS into CONSCIOUSNESS. We need to have one hundred percent consciousness.

The human being not only dreams when his physical body sleeps, but he also dreams when his physical body does not sleep, when he is in the waking state.

It is necessary to stop dreaming, it is necessary to awaken consciousness and this process of awakening must begin at home and at school.

The effort of the teachers must be directed to the CONSCIOUSNESS of the students and not only to the memory.

Students must learn to think for themselves and not just parrot or parrot the theories of others.

Teachers must strive to break down the fear of students.

Teachers must allow students the freedom to dissent and to criticise in a healthy and constructive way all the theories they study.

It is absurd to force them to DOGMATICALLY accept all the theories taught in school, college or university.

It is necessary for students to abandon fear so that they learn to think for themselves. It is urgent that students abandon fear so that they can analyse the theories they study.

Fear is one of the barriers to intelligence. The student with fear does NOT dare to dissent and accepts as an article of BLIND FAITH, whatever the different authors say.

It is of no use for teachers to talk about fearlessness if they themselves are afraid. Teachers must be free from fear. Teachers who fear criticism, fear of what people will say, etc., can NOT be truly intelligent.

The real goal of education must be to end fear and raise awareness.

What is the use of passing exams if we remain fearful and unaware?

Teachers have a duty to help students from the school benches to be useful in life, but as long as fear exists, no one can be useful in life.

The person full of fear does not dare to disagree with the opinion of others.

A person full of fear cannot have free initiative.

It is the task of every teacher, of course, to help each and every student in his or her school to be completely free of fear, so that they can act spontaneously without needing to be told, without needing to be commanded.

It is urgent that students let go of fear so that they can have free, spontaneous and creative initiative.

When students, on their own free and spontaneous initiative, can freely analyse and criticise the theories they study, then they will cease to be mere mechanical, subjective and stupid entities.

It is urgent that there be free initiative for creative intelligence to emerge in students.

It is necessary to give freedom of spontaneous CREATIVE EXPRESSION, without conditioning of any kind, to all students so that they can become aware of what they are studying.

Free creative power can only manifest itself when we are not afraid of criticism, of what people will say, of the teacher's iron rule, of rules etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

The human mind is degenerated by fear and dogmatism and it becomes URGENT to regenerate it through spontaneous free initiative and freedom from fear.

We need to become conscious of our own life and this process of awakening must begin from the very benches of the school.

School will be of little use to us if we leave it unconscious and asleep.

The abolition of fear and free initiative will give rise to spontaneous and pure action.

By free initiative the pupils should have the right in every school to discuss in assembly all the theories they are studying.

Only thus through freedom from fear and freedom to discuss, analyse, MEDITATE, and criticise in a healthy way what we are studying, can we become conscious of those subjects and not merely parrots or parrots who repeat what they accumulate in their memory.
