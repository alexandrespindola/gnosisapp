One of the greatest desires of psychology is to achieve TOTAL INTEGRATION.

If the SELF were INDIVIDUAL, the problem of PSYCHOLOGICAL INTEGRATION would be solved very easily, but unfortunately for the world, the SELF exists within each person in a PLURALIZED form.

The PLURALIZED SELF is the fundamental cause of all our intimate contradictions.

If we could see ourselves in a full-length mirror as we are PSYCHOLOGICALLY with all our intimate contradictions, we would come to the painful conclusion that we do not yet have true individuality.

The human organism is a wonderful machine controlled by the PLURALIZED SELF that is studied in depth by REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY.

"I'm going to read the newspaper," says the INTELLECTUAL SELF; "I want to attend the party," exclaims the EMOTIONAL SELF; "To HELL with the party," growls the SELF OF MOVEMENT, "I'd rather go for a walk," "I don't want to go for a walk," shouts the SELF of the instinct for conservation, "I'm hungry and I'm going to eat," etc.

Each of the little SELVES that make up the EGO wants to command, to be the master, the lord.

In the light of revolutionary psychology, we can understand that the SELF is legion and that the Organism is a machine.

The little SELVES quarrel with each other, they fight for supremacy, each one wants to be the boss, the master, the lord.

This explains the lamentable state of psychological disintegration in which the poor intellectual animal mistakenly called MAN lives.

It is necessary to understand what the word DISINTEGRATION means in PSYCHOLOGY. To disintegrate is to fall apart, to scatter, to tear, to contradict oneself, etc.

The main cause of PSYCHOLOGICAL DISINTEGRATION is envy, which is often manifested in exquisitely subtle and delightful forms.

Envy is multifaceted and there are thousands of reasons to justify it. Envy is the secret spring of all social machinery. Idiots love to justify envy.

The rich envy the rich and want to be richer. The poor envy the rich and want to be rich too. The one who writes envies the one who writes and wants to write better. The one who has a lot of experience envies the one who has more experience and wants to have more than that one.

People are not content with bread, shelter and refuge. The secret spring of envy for the other person's car, for the other person's house, for the neighbor's suit, for the friend's or enemy's much money, etc. produces desires to improve, to acquire things and more things, clothes, suits, virtues, so as not to be less than others etc. etc. etc.

The most tragic thing of all is that the cumulative process of experiences, virtues, things, money, etc. strengthens the PLURALIZED SELF, intensifying then within ourselves the intimate contradictions, the frightful tears, the cruel battles of our inner forum, etc. etc. etc.

All that is pain. None of that can bring true contentment to the afflicted heart. All that produces an increase of cruelty in our psyche, multiplication of pain, discontent that is ever deeper.

THE PLURALIZED SELF always finds justifications even for the worst crimes and that process of envying, acquiring, accumulating, getting, even when it is at the expense of other people's work, is called evolution, progress, advancement, etc.

People have a sleeping conscience and do not realize that they are envious, cruel, greedy, jealous, and when for some reason they come to realize all this, then they justify themselves, condemn, look for evasions, but they do not understand.

Envy is difficult to discover due to the concrete fact that the human mind is envious. The structure of the mind is based on envy and acquisition.

Envy begins from the school desks. We envy the better intelligence of our classmates, the better grades, the better suits, the better dresses, the better shoes, the better bicycle, the beautiful skates, the nice ball, etc. etc.

The teachers called to form the personality of the students must understand what the infinite processes of envy are and establish within the PSYCHE of their students the appropriate foundation for understanding.

The mind, envious by nature, only thinks in terms of MORE. "I can explain better, I have more knowledge, I am more intelligent, I have more virtues, more sanctifications, more perfections, more evolution, etc."

All the functionalism of the mind is based on the MORE. THE MORE is the intimate secret spring of envy.

THE MORE is the comparative process of the mind. Every comparative process is ABOMINABLE. Example: I am more intelligent than you. So-and-so is more virtuous than you. So-and-so is better than you, wiser, more benevolent, prettier, etc. etc.

THE MORE creates time. THE PLURALIZED SELF needs time to be better than the neighbor, to show the family that it is very brilliant and that it can, to become someone in life, to show its enemies, or those it envies, that it is more intelligent, more powerful, stronger, etc.

Comparative thinking is based on envy and produces what is called discontent, unease, bitterness.

Unfortunately people go from one opposite to another opposite, from one extreme to another, they do not know how to walk in the center. Many fight against discontent, envy, greed, jealousy, but the fight against discontent never brings true contentment of the heart.

It is urgent to understand that the true contentment of the tranquil heart is neither bought nor sold and is only born in us with complete naturalness and spontaneously when we have fully understood the very causes of discontent; jealousy, envy, greed, etc. etc.

Those who want to get money, a magnificent social position, virtues, satisfactions of all kinds, etc. with the purpose of reaching true contentment, are totally mistaken because all that is based on envy and the path of envy can never lead us to the port of the tranquil and content heart.

The mind bottled up in the PLURALIZED SELF makes envy a virtue and even allows itself the luxury of giving it delightful names. Progress, spiritual evolution, desire for self-improvement, struggle for dignification, etc. etc. etc.

All this produces disintegration, intimate contradictions, secret struggles, a problem of difficult solution, etc.

It is difficult to find in life someone who is truly INTEGRAL in the fullest sense of the word.

It is totally impossible to achieve TOTAL INTEGRATION while the PLURALIZED SELF exists within ourselves.

It is urgent to understand that within each person there are three basic factors, First: Personality. Second: PLURALIZED SELF. Third: The psychic material, that is, THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE PERSON.

The PLURALIZED SELF clumsily wastes the psychological material in atomic explosions of envy, jealousy, greed, etc. etc. It is necessary to dissolve the pluralized SELF, with the purpose of accumulating within, the psychic material to establish within us a permanent center of consciousness.

Those who do not possess a permanent center of consciousness cannot be integral.

Only the permanent center of consciousness gives us true individuality.

Only the permanent center of consciousness makes us integral.
