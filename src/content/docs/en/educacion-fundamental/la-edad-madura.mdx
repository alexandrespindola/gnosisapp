Middle age begins at thirty-five and ends at fifty-six.

The middle-aged man should know how to govern his household and guide his children.

In normal life, every middle-aged man is the head of the family. The man who has not established his home and fortune during youth and middle age will no longer do so; he is, in fact, a failure.

Those who try to establish a home and fortune during old age are truly worthy of pity.

The EGO of greed goes to extremes and wants to accumulate rich fortunes. The human being needs bread, shelter and refuge. It is necessary to have bread, a home of one's own, clothes, suits, coats to cover the body, but it is not necessary to accumulate enormous sums of money in order to live.

We do not defend wealth or misery; both extremes are condemnable.

Many are those who wallow in the mud of misery, and there are also quite a few who wallow in the mud of wealth.

It is necessary to possess a modest fortune, that is, a beautiful house with beautiful gardens, a secure source of income, to always be well-presented and not go hungry. This is normal for every human being.

Misery, hunger, disease and ignorance must never exist in any country that prides itself on being cultured and civilised.

Democracy does not yet exist, but we need to create it. While there is a single citizen without bread, shelter and refuge, democracy is practically nothing more than a beautiful ideal.

Heads of families must be understanding, intelligent, never wine drinkers, gluttons, drunkards, tyrants, etc.

Every mature man knows from his own experience that children imitate his example, and if the latter is wrong, it will mark absurd paths for his descendants.

It is truly stupid for a mature man to have several women and live in drunkenness, banquets, orgies, etc.

The responsibility of the entire family weighs on the mature man, and it is clear that if he walks down the wrong paths, he will bring more disorder to the world, more confusion, more bitterness.

The father and mother must understand the difference between the sexes. It is absurd for daughters to study physics, chemistry, algebra, etc. The brain of the woman is different from that of the man; such subjects are very much in accordance with the male sex but are useless and even harmful to the female mind.

It is necessary for parents to fight with all their heart to promote a vital change in every school curriculum.

The woman should learn to read, write, play the piano, weave, embroider and in general all kinds of feminine crafts.

The woman must be prepared from the very benches of the school for the sublime mission that corresponds to her as a MOTHER and as a wife.

It is absurd to damage the brains of women with complicated and difficult studies proper to the male sex.

It is necessary for both parents and teachers of schools, colleges and universities to worry more about bringing the woman to the femininity that corresponds to her. It is stupid to militarise women, to force them to march with flags and drums through the streets of cities as if they were males.

The woman must be very feminine and the man must be very masculine.

The intermediate sex, homosexuality, is the product of degeneration and barbarism.

Young women who dedicate themselves to long and difficult studies become old and no one marries them.

In modern life it is convenient for women to pursue short careers: beauty culture, typing, shorthand, sewing, pedagogy, etc., etc., etc.

Normally, the woman should only be dedicated to home life, but due to the cruelty of this era in which we live, the woman needs to work to eat and live.

In a truly cultured and civilised society, the woman does not need to work outside the home in order to live. This of working outside the home is cruelty of the worst kind.

The current degenerate man has created a false order of things, and has made the woman lose her femininity, has taken her out of her home and has turned her into a slave.

The woman converted into a "tomboy" with the intellect of a man, smoking cigarettes and reading the newspaper, semi-nude with skirts above her knees or playing canasta, is the result of the degenerate men of this era, the social scourge of a civilisation that is dying.

The woman converted into a modern spy, the drug-addicted doctor, the woman champion of sport, alcoholic, denatured who denies the breast to her children so as not to lose her beauty is the execrable symptom of a false civilisation.

The time has come to organise the world salvation army with men and women of goodwill who are truly willing to fight against this false order of things.

The time has come to establish a new civilisation, a new culture in the world.

The woman is the fundamental stone of the home and if this stone is poorly worked, full of edges and deformations of all kinds, the result of social life will be catastrophe.

The male is distinct, different and therefore can afford to study medicine, physics, chemistry, mathematics, law, engineering, astronomy, etc., etc., etc.

A militarised school for males is not absurd, but a militarised school for women, in addition to being absurd, is frighteningly ridiculous.

It is disgusting to see the future wives, the future mothers who are to carry the child in their bosom marching like men through the streets of the city.

This not only indicates a loss of femininity in the sex, but also puts the finger on the sore spot, pointing out the loss of masculinity in the man.

The man, a real man, the very macho man cannot accept, let alone, a militarised parade of women. Male scruples, the psychological idiosyncrasy of the male, the thought of the man feels real disgust for this kind of spectacle that demonstrates to satiety human degeneration.

We need the woman to return to her home, to her femininity, to her natural beauty, to her primitive ingenuity, and to her true simplicity. We need to end this whole order of things and establish a new civilisation and a new sculpture on the face of the earth.

Parents and educators must know how to raise the new generations with true wisdom and love.

Male children must not only receive intellectual information and learn a trade or receive a professional title. It is necessary for males to know the sense of responsibility and to walk the path of righteousness and conscious love.

The responsibility of a wife, children and daughters weighs on the shoulders of the mature man.

The mature man with a high sense of responsibility, chaste, sober, temperate, virtuous, etc., is respected by his family and by all citizens.

The mature man who scandalises people with his adulteries, fornications, disgusts, injustices of all kinds, becomes repugnant to all people and not only causes pain to himself but also embitters his relatives and brings pain and confusion to the whole world.

It is necessary for the mature man to know how to live his time correctly. It is urgent that the mature man understand that youth has passed.

It is ridiculous to want to repeat in maturity the same dramas and scenes of youth.

Each stage of life has its beauty, and you have to know how to live it.

The mature man must work with great intensity before old age arrives, just as the ant acts in a preventive way carrying leaves for its anthill before the harsh winter arrives, so too must the mature man act quickly and with foresight.

Many young men miserably spend all their vital values, and when they reach middle age they find themselves ugly, horrible, miserable, failed.

It is truly ridiculous to see many mature men repeating the pranks of youth without realising that they are now horrible and that youth is gone.

One of the greatest calamities of this dying civilisation is the vice of alcohol.

In youth many give themselves to drink and when middle age arrives they have not formed a home, they have not formed a fortune, they do not have a lucrative profession, they live from cantina to cantina begging for liquor, frighteningly horrible, disgusting, miserable.

Heads of families and educators should pay special attention to young people, guiding them rightly with the healthy purpose of making a better world.
