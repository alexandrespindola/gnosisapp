Middle age begins at thirty-five and ends at fifty-six.

A middle-aged man should know how to govern his household and guide his children.

In normal life, every middle-aged man is the head of the family. The man who has not established his home and fortune during youth and middle age will no longer do so, and is in fact a failure.

Those who attempt to establish a home and fortune during old age are truly worthy of pity.

The EGO of greed goes to extremes and wants to accumulate vast fortunes. Human beings need bread, shelter, and refuge. It is necessary to have bread, a home of one's own, clothes, suits, coats to cover the body, but it is not necessary to accumulate enormous sums of money in order to live.

We do not defend wealth or misery; both extremes are condemnable.

Many wallow in the mud of misery, and quite a few wallow in the mud of wealth.

It is necessary to possess a modest fortune, that is, a beautiful house with beautiful gardens, a secure source of income, to always be well-presented and not go hungry. This is normal for every human being.

Misery, hunger, disease, and ignorance must never exist in any country that considers itself cultured and civilised.

Democracy does not yet exist, but we need to create it. While even one citizen lacks bread, shelter, and refuge, democracy practically remains nothing more than a beautiful ideal.

Heads of families must be understanding, intelligent, never wine drinkers, gluttons, drunks, tyrants, etc.

Every mature man knows from his own experience that children imitate his example, and that if the latter is wrong, it will mark absurd paths for his descendants.

It is truly stupid for a mature man to have several women and live in drunkenness, banquets, orgies, etc.

The responsibility of the entire family rests on the mature man, and it is clear that if he walks the wrong paths, he will bring more disorder to the world, more confusion, more bitterness.

The father and mother must understand the difference between the sexes. It is absurd for daughters to study physics, chemistry, algebra, etc. The brain of a woman is different from that of a man; such subjects are very much in agreement with the male sex but are useless and even harmful to the female mind.

It is necessary for parents to fight wholeheartedly to promote a vital change in every school curriculum.

A woman should learn to read, write, play the piano, knit, embroider, and in general all kinds of feminine crafts.

A woman should be prepared from the school benches for the sublime mission that corresponds to her as MOTHER and as wife.

It is absurd to damage the brains of women with complicated and difficult studies suitable for the male sex.

It is necessary for both parents and teachers of schools, colleges, and universities to worry more about bringing women to the femininity that corresponds to them. It is stupid to militarise women, to force them to march with flags and drums through the streets of cities as if they were males.

A woman should be very feminine, and a man should be very masculine.

The intermediate sex, homosexuality, is the product of degeneration and barbarism.

Young ladies who dedicate themselves to long and difficult studies become old and no one marries them.

In modern life, it is convenient for women to have short careers, beauty culture, typing, shorthand, sewing, pedagogy, etc., etc., etc.

Normally, a woman should only be dedicated to home life, but due to the cruelty of this era in which we live, a woman needs to work to eat and live.

In a truly cultured and civilised society, a woman does not need to work outside the home to be able to live. This working outside the home is cruelty of the worst kind.

The current degenerate man has created a false order of things, and has caused women to lose their femininity, has taken them out of their homes and turned them into slaves.

The woman turned into a "tomboy" with the intellect of a man, smoking cigarettes and reading newspapers, semi-nude with skirts above the knees or playing canasta, is the result of the degenerate men of this era, the social scourge of a civilisation that is dying.

The woman turned into a modern spy, the drug-addicted doctor, the female sports champion, an alcoholic, denatured woman who denies her breast to her children so as not to lose her beauty is the execrable symptom of a false civilisation.

The time has come to organise the army of world salvation with men and women of goodwill who are truly willing to fight against this false order of things.

The time has come to establish a new civilisation, a new culture in the world.

The woman is the fundamental stone of the home, and if this stone is badly worked, full of edges and deformations of all kinds, the result of social life will be catastrophe.

The male is different, different, and therefore can afford to study medicine, physics, chemistry, mathematics, law, engineering, astronomy, etc., etc., etc.

A militarised college of males is not absurd, but a militarised college of women, in addition to being absurd, is frighteningly ridiculous.

It is disgusting to see future wives, future mothers who have to carry the child between their breasts marching like men along the city streets.

This not only indicates a loss of femininity in the sex, but also puts its finger on the sore spot, pointing to the loss of masculinity in men.

The man, the real man, the very macho man cannot accept or like a militarised parade of women. The masculine scruple, the psychological idiosyncrasy of the male, the thought of the man feels true disgust for this kind of spectacle that demonstrates to satiety human degeneration.

We need women to return to their homes, to their femininity, to their natural beauty, to their primitive innocence, and to their true simplicity. We need to end this entire order of things and establish on the face of the earth a new civilisation and a new culture.

Parents and educators must know how to raise the new generations with true wisdom and love.

Male children should not only receive intellectual information and learn a trade or receive a professional title. It is necessary for males to know the sense of responsibility and to follow the path of righteousness and conscious love.

The responsibility of a wife, sons and daughters rests on the shoulders of a mature man.

The mature man with a high sense of responsibility, chaste, sober, temperate, virtuous, etc., is respected by his family and by all citizens.

The mature man who scandalises people with his adulteries, fornications, disgust, injustices of all kinds, becomes repugnant to all people and not only causes pain to himself but also embitters his family and brings pain and confusion to the whole world.

It is necessary for a mature man to know how to live his time correctly. It is urgent for a mature man to understand that youth has passed.

It is ridiculous to want to repeat the same dramas and scenes of youth in maturity.

Each stage of life has its beauty, and you have to know how to live it.

The mature man must work with great intensity before old age arrives, just as the ant acts in a preventive way taking leaves for its anthill before the harsh winter arrives, so too must the mature man act quickly and with foresight.

Many young men waste all their vital values ​​miserably, and when they reach middle age they are ugly, horrible, miserable, failed.

It is truly ridiculous to see many mature men repeating the escapades of youth without realising that they are now horrible and that youth is gone.

One of the greatest calamities of this civilisation that is dying is the vice of alcohol.

In youth, many give themselves to drinking, and when middle age arrives they have not formed a home, they have not formed a fortune, they do not have a lucrative profession, they live from bar to bar begging for liquor, frighteningly horrible, disgusting, miserable.

Heads of families and educators must pay special attention to young people, orienting them correctly with the healthy purpose of making a better world.
