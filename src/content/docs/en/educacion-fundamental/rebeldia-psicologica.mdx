Those who have dedicated themselves to travelling through all the countries of the world with the purpose of studying in detail all the human races, have been able to verify for themselves that the nature of this poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called man, is always the same, whether in old Europe or in Africa tired of so much slavery, in the sacred land of the Vedas or in the West Indies, in Austria or in China.

This concrete fact, this tremendous reality that amazes every studious man, can especially be verified if the traveller visits Schools, Colleges and Universities.

We have reached the era of mass production. Now everything is produced on a successive belt and on a large scale. Series of Airplanes, Cars, Luxury Goods, etc., etc., etc.

Although it may be a little grotesque, it is very true that Industrial Schools, Universities, etc. have also become intellectual factories of mass production.

In these times of mass production, the only goal in life is to find economic security. People are afraid of everything and seek security.

Independent thinking in these times of mass production is becoming almost impossible because the modern type of education is based on mere conveniences.

"The New Wave" lives very comfortably with this intellectual mediocrity. If someone wants to be different, distinct from others, everyone disqualifies them, everyone criticises them, they are ostracised, they are denied work, etc.

The desire to get money to live and have fun, the urgency to achieve success in life, the search for economic security, the desire to buy many things to show off to others, etc., put a stop to pure, natural and spontaneous thought.

It has been fully proven that fear dulls the mind and hardens the heart.

In these times of so much fear and search for security, people hide in their caves, in their burrows, in their corner, in the place where they believe they can have more security, fewer problems and they do not want to leave there, they are terrified of life, afraid of new adventures, new experiences, etc., etc., etc.

All this much-TOUTED modern education is based on fear and the search for security, people are frightened, they are even afraid of their own shadow.

People are terrified of everything, they are afraid to break away from the old established norms, to be different from other people, to think in a revolutionary way, to break with all the prejudices of decadent Society, etc.

Fortunately, there live in the world a few sincere and understanding people, who truly wish to examine deeply all the problems of the mind, but in the great majority of us there does not even exist the spirit of nonconformity and rebellion.

There are two types of REBELLION that are already duly classified. First: Violent Psychological Rebellion. Second: Deep Psychological Rebellion of INTELLIGENCE.

The first type of Rebellion is Reactionary, conservative and retardatory. The second type of Rebellion is REVOLUTIONARY.

In the first type of Psychological Rebellion we find the REFORMER who mends old suits and repairs walls of old buildings so that they do not collapse, the regressive type, the Revolutionary of blood and liquor, the leader of military coups and coups d'Ã©tat, the man with a rifle on his shoulder, the Dictator who enjoys taking to the wall all those who do not accept his whims, his theories.

In the second type of Psychological Rebellion we find BUDDHA, JESUS, HERMES, the transformer, the INTELLIGENT REBEL, the INTUITIVE, the GREAT champions of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, etc., etc., etc.

Those who only educate themselves with the absurd purpose of climbing magnificent positions within the bureaucratic hive, climbing, climbing to the top of the ladder, making themselves felt, etc., lack true depth, are Imbeciles by nature, superficial, hollow, one hundred percent rogues.

It has been proven to satiety that when in the human being there is no true INTEGRATION of thought and feeling, even if we have received a great education, life is incomplete, contradictory, boring and tormented by countless fears of all kinds.

Beyond any doubt and without fear of being wrong, we can emphatically affirm that without INTEGRAL education, life is harmful, useless and detrimental.

THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL has an INTERNAL EGO unfortunately composed of distant ENTITIES that are strengthened by WRONG EDUCATION.

THE PLURALIZED SELF that each of us carries within, is the fundamental cause of all our complexes and contradictions.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION should teach the new generations our Psychological DIDACTICS for the DISSOLUTION of the SELF.

Only by dissolving the various entities that together constitute the Ego (SELF) can we establish in ourselves a permanent centre of individual consciousness, then we will be INTEGRAL.

While there exists within each of us THE PLURALIZED SELF, we will not only embitter life to ourselves but we will also embitter it to others.

What good is it that we study law and become lawyers, if we perpetuate lawsuits? What good is it to accumulate many knowledge in our mind, if we continue confused? What good are technical and industrial skills if we use them for the destruction of our fellow men?

It is useless to instruct ourselves, attend classes, study, if in the process of daily living we are miserably destroying each other.

The objective of education should not be only to produce each year new job seekers, new type of rogues, new oafs who do not even know how to respect the Religion of their neighbour, etc.

The true objective of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION should be to create true INTEGRATED men and women and therefore conscious and intelligent.

Unfortunately the Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities, all think, except in awakening the INTEGRAL INTELLIGENCE of the EDUCANDS.

Anyone can covet and acquire titles, decorations, diplomas and even become very efficient in the mechanistic terrain of life, but this does not mean being INTELLIGENT.

INTELLIGENCE can never be mere mechanical functionalism, INTELLIGENCE cannot be the result of simple bookish information, INTELLIGENCE is not the ability to react automatically with sparkling words to any challenge. INTELLIGENCE is not mere verbalisation of memory. INTELLIGENCE is the ability to receive directly the ESSENCE, the REAL, what truly IS.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is the science that allows us to awaken this capacity in ourselves and in others.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION helps each INDIVIDUAL to discover the true VALUES that arise as a result of deep investigation and INTEGRAL COMPREHENSION of HIMSELF.

When there is no SELF-KNOWLEDGE in us, then SELF-EXPRESSION becomes SELFISH AND DESTRUCTIVE SELF-AFFIRMATION.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is only concerned with awakening in each individual THE CAPACITY to understand himself in all the terrains of the mind and not simply to indulge in the complacency of the mistaken SELF-EXPRESSION of the PLURALIZED SELF.
