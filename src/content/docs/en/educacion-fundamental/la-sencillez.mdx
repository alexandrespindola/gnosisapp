It is urgent, it is essential to develop creative understanding because it brings true freedom of living to the human being. Without understanding, it is impossible to achieve the authentic critical faculty of deep analysis.

Teachers in schools, colleges and universities must lead their students along the path of self-critical understanding.

In our previous chapter, we already studied the processes of envy extensively, and if we want to eliminate all the nuances of jealousy, whether religious, passionate, etc., we must become fully aware of what envy really is, because only by deeply and intimately understanding the infinite processes of envy can we eliminate all types of jealousy.

Jealousy destroys marriages, jealousy destroys friendships, jealousy provokes religious wars, fratricidal hatred, murders and suffering of all kinds.

Envy, with all its infinite nuances, hides behind sublime purposes. Envy exists in the person who, having been informed about the existence of sublime saints, Mahatmas or Gurus, also wishes to become a saint. Envy exists in the philanthropist who strives to surpass other philanthropists. Envy exists in every individual who covets virtues because they have been informed, because in their mind there is data about the existence of sacred individuals full of virtues.

The desire to be a saint, the desire to be virtuous, the desire to be great is based on envy.

The saints with their virtues have caused much damage. We are reminded of the case of a man who considered himself very holy.

On one occasion, a hungry and miserable poet knocked on his doors to place in his hands a beautiful verse specially dedicated to the saint of our story. The poet only expected a coin to buy food for his exhausted and aged body.

The poet imagined everything but an insult. Great was his surprise when the saint, with a pious look and a furrowed brow, closed the door, saying to the unhappy poet: "get out of here friend, away, away... I don't like these things, I abhor flattery... I don't like the vanities of the world, this life is an illusion... I follow the path of humility and modesty. The unhappy poet who only wanted a coin instead received the insult of the saint, the word that hurts, the slap, and with a sore heart and the lyre turned to pieces, he went slowly through the streets of the city... slowly... slowly...

The new generation must rise on the basis of authentic understanding because it is totally creative.

Memory and recollection are not creative. Memory is the tomb of the past. Memory and recollection are death.

True understanding is the psychological factor of total liberation.

The memories of memory can never bring us true liberation because they belong to the past and are therefore dead.

Understanding is not a thing of the past nor of the future. Understanding belongs to the moment we are living here and now. Memory always brings the idea of the future.

It is urgent to study science, philosophy, art and religion, but studies should not be entrusted to the fidelity of memory because it is not faithful.

It is absurd to deposit knowledge in the tomb of memory. It is stupid to bury in the pit of the past the knowledge that we must understand.

We could never pronounce ourselves against study, against wisdom, against science, but it is incongruous to deposit the living jewels of knowledge among the corrupted tomb of memory.

It is necessary to study, it is necessary to investigate, it is necessary to analyse, but we must meditate deeply to understand at all levels of the mind.

The truly simple man is deeply understanding and has a simple mind.

The important thing in life is not what we have accumulated in the tomb of memory, but what we have understood not only on the intellectual level but also in the different subconscious unconscious terrains of the mind.

Science, knowledge, must become immediate understanding. When knowledge, when study has been transformed into authentic creative understanding, we can then understand all things immediately because understanding becomes immediate, instantaneous.

In the simple man there are no complications in the mind because every complication of the mind is due to memory. The Machiavellian SELF that we carry within is accumulated memory.

Life's experiences must be transformed into true understanding.

When experiences do not become understanding, when experiences continue in memory, they constitute the rot of the tomb upon which burns the fatuous and Luciferian flame of the intellect.

It is necessary to know that the animal intellect totally devoid of all spirituality is only the verbalisation of memory, the sepulchral candle burning on the funeral slab.

The simple man has a mind free of experiences because these have become conscience, have been transformed into creative understanding.

Death and life are intimately associated. Only by dying does the grain give birth to the plant, only by dying does the experience give birth to understanding. This is a process of authentic transformation.

The complicated man has a memory full of experiences.

This demonstrates his lack of creative understanding because when experiences are fully understood at all levels of the mind, they cease to exist as experiences and are born as understanding.

It is necessary to experience first, but we must not remain in the realm of experience because then the mind becomes complicated and difficult. It is necessary to live life intensely and transform all experiences into authentic creative understanding.

Those who mistakenly assume that in order to be understanding, simple and uncomplicated we have to abandon the world, become beggars, live in isolated huts and wear loincloths instead of elegant suits, are totally wrong.

Many anchorites, many solitary hermits, many beggars, have extremely complicated and difficult minds.

It is useless to separate oneself from the world and live as anchorites if memory is full of experiences that condition the free flow of thought.

It is useless to live as hermits wanting to lead the life of saints if memory is filled with information that has not been properly understood, that has not become conscious in the different nooks, corridors and unconscious regions of the mind.

Those who transform intellectual information into true creative understanding, those who transform life experiences into true in-depth understanding have nothing in memory, live from moment to moment full of true fullness, have become simple and uncomplicated even if they live in sumptuous residences and within the perimeter of urban life.

Young children before the age of seven are full of simplicity and true inner beauty because only the living ESSENCE of life is expressed through them in the total absence of the PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF.

We must regain the lost childhood, in our heart and in our mind. We must regain innocence if we truly want to be happy.

Experiences and study transformed into in-depth understanding leave no residue in the tomb of memory and then, we become simple, uncomplicated, innocent, happy.

Deep meditation on experiences and acquired knowledge, deep self-criticism, intimate psychoanalysis convert, transform everything into deep creative understanding. This is the path of authentic happiness born of wisdom and love.
