Through experience, we have been able to verify that it is impossible to understand THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE until we have fully comprehended the complex problem of the MIND.

Those who assume that the MIND is the BRAIN are completely mistaken. The "MIND" is ENERGETIC, subtle, it can become independent of MATTER, and in certain hypnotic states or during normal sleep, it can transport itself to very distant places to see and hear what is happening in those locations.
