Through experience, we have seen that it is impossible to understand THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE until we have comprehensively understood the complex problem of the MIND.

Those who assume that the MIND is the BRAIN are completely mistaken. The MIND is ENERGETIC, subtle, it can become independent of MATTER, it can, in certain hypnotic states or during normal sleep, transport itself to very remote places to see and hear what is happening in those places.

In PARAPSYCHOLOGY laboratories, remarkable experiments are done with subjects in a HYPNOTIC state.

Many subjects in a HYPNOTIC state have been able to report in detail about events, people and situations that were happening at remote distances during their hypnotic trance.

Scientists have been able to verify the reality of this INFORMATION after these experiments. They have been able to verify the reality of the facts, the accuracy of the EVENTS.

With these experiments in PARAPSYCHOLOGY laboratories, it is completely demonstrated by observation and experience that the BRAIN is not the MIND.

Truly and truthfully we can say that the mind can travel through time and space, independently of the brain, to see and hear things that happen in distant places.

The REALITY of EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTIONS is now ABSOLUTELY demonstrated and only a madman or an idiot could think of denying the reality of EXTRA PERCEPTIONS.

The brain is made to elaborate thought but is not thought itself. The brain is only the instrument of the MIND, it is not the mind.

We need to study the mind in depth if we truly want to know comprehensively that which is called LOVE.

Children and young people, male and female, have more elastic, ductile, quick, alert minds, etc.

Many children and young people enjoy asking their parents and teachers about such and such things, they want to know something more, they want to know and that is why they ask, observe, see certain details that adults despise or do not perceive.

As the years pass, as we advance in age, the mind gradually crystallises.

The mind of the elderly is fixed, petrified, it no longer changes even with cannons.

The old are already like that and die like that, they do not change, they approach everything from a fixed point.

The "SENILITY" of the old, their prejudices, fixed ideas, etc. all seem together like a ROCK, a STONE that does not change in any way. That is why the common saying goes "CHARACTER AND HABIT UNTIL THE GRAVE".

It is URGENT that teachers in charge of shaping the PERSONALITY of students, study the mind in depth, so that they can guide the new generations intelligently.

It is painful to fully understand how the MIND gradually petrifies over time.

The MIND is the killer of the REAL, of the true. The MIND destroys LOVE.

He who grows old is no longer capable of LOVE because his mind is full of painful experiences, prejudices, fixed ideas like steel points, etc.

There are green old men out there who believe they are still capable of LOVE, but what happens is that these old men are full of senile sexual passions and confuse PASSION with LOVE.

Every "DIRTY OLD MAN" and "DIRTY OLD WOMAN" go through tremendous lustful passionate states before dying and they believe that this is LOVE.

The LOVE of the old is impossible because the mind destroys it with its "SENILITIES" FIXED IDEAS", PREJUDICES", "JEALOUSIES", "EXPERIENCES", MEMORIES", sexual passions, etc. etc. etc.

The MIND is the worst enemy of LOVE. In SUPER-CIVILISED countries LOVE no longer exists because the minds of the people only smell of factories, bank accounts, petrol and celluloid.

There are many bottles for the mind and each person's mind is very well bottled.

Some have the MIND bottled in ABOMINABLE COMMUNISM, others have it bottled in ruthless CAPITALISM.

There are those who have the MIND BOTTLED in jealousy, in hatred, in the desire to be rich, in good social standing, in pessimism, in attachment to certain people, in attachment to their own sufferings, in their family problems, etc. etc. etc.

People love to bottle the MIND, Rare are those who truly resolve to smash the bottle to pieces.

We need to LIBERATE THE MIND but people like slavery, it is very rare to find someone in life who does not have the MIND well bottled.

Teachers should teach their students all these things. They must teach the new generations to investigate their own minds, to observe them, to understand them, only in this way through profound UNDERSTANDING can we prevent the mind from crystallising, freezing, bottling up.

The only thing that can transform the world is that which is called LOVE, but the mind destroys LOVE.

We need to STUDY our own mind, observe it, investigate it deeply, understand it truly. Only in this way, only by becoming masters of ourselves, of our own minds, will we kill the killer of LOVE and be truly happy.

Those who live fantasising beautifully about LOVE, those who live making plans about LOVE, those who want LOVE to operate according to their tastes and dislikes, plans and fantasies, norms and prejudices, memories and experiences, etc. will never really know what LOVE is, in fact they have become enemies of LOVE.

It is necessary to understand in a COMPREHENSIVE way what the processes of the mind are in a state of accumulating experiences.

The teacher scolds many times justly but sometimes stupidly and without real reason, without understanding that every unjust scolding is deposited in the minds of the students, the result of such an incorrect procedure is usually the loss of LOVE for the TEACHER.

The MIND destroys LOVE and this is something that TEACHERS of schools, colleges and universities must never forget.

It is necessary to fully understand all those mental processes that end the beauty of LOVE.

It is not enough to be a father or mother, you have to know how to LOVE. Fathers and mothers believe they love their sons and daughters because they have them, because they are theirs, because they possess them, like someone who has a bicycle, a car, a house.

That sense of possession of dependence is often confused with LOVE but could never be LOVE.

The teachers of our second home, which is the school, believe that they love their disciples because they belong to them as such, because they possess them, but that is not LOVE. The sense of possession or dependence IS NOT LOVE.

The MIND destroys LOVE and only by understanding all the wrong functionalisms of the mind, our absurd way of thinking, our bad habits, automatic, mechanistic habits, the wrong way of seeing things, etc. can we come to experience, to truly experience that which does not belong to time, that which is called LOVE.

Those who want LOVE to become a piece of their own routine machine, those who want LOVE to walk along the wrong tracks of their own prejudices, appetites, fears, experiences of life, selfish way of seeing things, wrong way of thinking, etc. end up in fact with LOVE because it never lets itself be subjected.

Those who want LOVE to work as I WANT, as I DESIRE, as I THINK, lose LOVE because CUPID, the GOD of LOVE, is never willing to be enslaved by the I.

We must end the I, with MYSELF, with the SELF so as not to lose the child of LOVE.

The I is a bunch of memories, appetites, fears, hatreds, passions, experiences, selfishness, envies, greed, lust, etc. etc. etc.

Only by understanding each defect separately; only by studying it, observing it directly not only in the intellectual region, but also in all the subconscious levels of the mind, does each defect disappear, we die from moment to moment. Thus and only thus do we achieve the disintegration of the I.

Those who want to bottle LOVE inside the horrible bottle of the I, lose LOVE, they are left without it, because LOVE can never be bottled.

Unfortunately, people want LOVE to behave according to their own habits, desires, customs, etc., people want LOVE to submit to the I and that is completely impossible because LOVE does not obey the I.

Couples in love, or rather we should say passionate, assume that LOVE should march faithfully along the tracks of their own desires, concupiscences, errors, etc., and in this they are totally mistaken.

"Let's talk about the two of us!", say lovers or sexually passionate people, which is what abounds most in this World, and then come the talks, the projects, the longings and sighs. Each one says something, exposes their projects, their desires, their way of seeing the things of life and wants LOVE to move like a railway engine on the steel tracks drawn by the mind.

How wrong these Lovers or passionate people are!, how far they are from reality.

LOVE does not obey the I and when the spouses want to put chains around its neck and subdue it, it flees leaving the couple in disgrace.

The MIND has the bad taste of comparing. The man compares one girlfriend with another. The woman compares one man with another. The Teacher compares one student with another, one student with another as if all her students did not deserve the same appreciation. Really all comparison is ABOMINABLE.

He who contemplates a beautiful sunset and compares it with another, does not really know how to understand the beauty that he has before his eyes.

He who contemplates a beautiful mountain and compares it with another that he saw yesterday, is not really understanding the beauty of the mountain that he has before his eyes.

Where COMPARISON exists there is no TRUE LOVE. The Father and Mother who truly love their children never compare them with anyone, they love them and that's all.

The husband who really loves his wife never makes the mistake of comparing her with anyone, he loves her and that's all.

The TEACHER who loves his students never discriminates against them, never compares them with each other, he truly loves them and that's all.

The Mind Divided by comparisons, the mind enslaved by DUALISM, destroys LOVE.

The Mind divided by the struggle of opposites is not capable of understanding the new, it petrifies, it freezes.

THE MIND HAS MANY DEPTHS, Regions, subconscious terrains, recesses, but the best is the ESSENCE, the CONSCIENCE and it is in the Centre.

When DUALISM ends, when the mind becomes INTEGRAL, SERENE, QUIET, PROFOUND, when it no longer compares, then the ESSENCE, the CONSCIENCE awakens and that should be the true objective of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

Let us distinguish between OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE. In the OBJECTIVE there is awake consciousness. In the SUBJECTIVE there is sleeping Consciousness, SUBCONSCIOUSNESS.

Only OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS can enjoy OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.

The intellectual information currently received by Students of all Schools, Colleges and Universities is one hundred percent SUBJECTIVE.

OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE cannot be acquired without OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

Students must first arrive at SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and then at OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

Only by the PATH OF LOVE can we arrive at OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS and OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.

It is necessary to understand the COMPLEX PROBLEM OF THE MIND if we truly want to travel the PATH OF LOVE.
