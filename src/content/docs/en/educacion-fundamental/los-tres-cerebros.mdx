    label: 21. The Three Brains
    order: 21
---
The revolutionary psychology of the new era affirms that the organic machine of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL, falsely called man, exists in a three-centred or three-brained form.

The first brain is enclosed in the cranial box. The second brain corresponds specifically to the spinal column with its central medulla and all its nerve branches. The third brain does not reside in a defined place nor is it a specific organ. Really, the third brain is constituted by the sympathetic nervous plexuses and in general by all the specific nervous centres of the human organism.

The first brain is the thinking centre. The second brain is the centre of movement, commonly called the motor centre. The third brain is the emotional centre.

It is completely demonstrated in practice that all abuse of the thinking brain produces excessive expenditure of intellectual energy. It is therefore logical to affirm without fear of doubt that asylums are true cemeteries of intellectual dead.

Harmonious and balanced sports are useful for the motor brain, but abuse of sport means excessive expenditure of motor energies and the result is usually disastrous. It is not absurd to affirm that there are dead of the motor brain. Said dead are known as sufferers of Hemiplegia, Paraplegia, progressive Paralysis, etc.

The aesthetic sense, mysticism, ecstasy, superior music, are necessary to cultivate the emotional centre, but abuse of said brain produces useless wear and tear and squandering of emotional energies. The existentialists of the "new wave", the fanatics of Rock, the sensual Pseudo-Artists of modern art, the morbid passionaries of sensuality, etc., etc. abuse the emotional brain.

Even when it seems incredible, death is certainly processed by thirds in each person. It is already proven to satiety that all illness has its base in any of the three brains.

The great law has wisely deposited in each of the three brains of the intellectual animal, a determined capital of VITAL VALUES. Saving said capital means in fact lengthening life, wasting said capital produces death.

Archaic traditions that have reached us from the terrifying night of the centuries, affirm that the average of human life in the Ancient Continent MU, situated in the Pacific Ocean, oscillated between Twelve and Fifteen Centuries.

With the passing of the centuries through all ages the equivocal use of the three brains was shortening life little by little.

In the sunny country of KEM... there in the old Egypt of the Pharaohs the average of human life reached only one hundred and forty years.

Currently in these modern times of petrol and celluloid, in this epoch of existentialism and rebels of Rock, the average of human life according to some Insurance companies, is scarcely of fifty years.

The Marxist-Leninist Gentlemen of the SOVIET UNION, braggarts and liars as always, are saying around that they have invented very special serums to lengthen life but the old man Kruschev still does not have eighty years and has to ask permission from one foot to lift the other.

In the centre of ASIA there exists a religious community constituted by elders that already do not even remember their youth. The average of life of those elders oscillates between four hundred and five hundred years.

All the Secret of long life of these Asiatic Monks consists of the wise use of the three brains.

The balanced and harmonious functionalism of the three brains means saving of the VITAL VALUES and as logical sequence, prolongation of life.

There exists a cosmic Law known as "EQUALISATION OF THE VIBRATIONS OF MANY SOURCES". The Monks of said Monastery know to use said law by means of the use of the three brains.

Extemporaneous pedagogy leads the pupils to the abuse of the thinking brain whose results Psychiatry already knows.

The intelligent cultivation of the three brains is FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION. In the ancient schools of mysteries of Babylon, Greece, India, Persia, Egypt, etc., the pupils received integral direct information, for their three brains by means of the precept, the dance, the music, etc., intelligently combined.

The theatres of the ancient times formed part of the school. The drama, the comedy, the tragedy, combined with the special mimicry, the music, the oral teaching, etc.. Served to inform the three brains of each individual.

Then the students did not abuse the thinking brain and knew to use with intelligence and in a balanced form their three brains.

The dances of the mysteries of Eleusis in Greece, the theatre in Babylon, the sculpture in Greece were always used to transmit knowledges to the disciples.

Now in these degenerate times of the Rock, the pupils confused and disoriented go by the tenebrous path of the mental abuse.

At the moment there do not exist true creating systems for the harmonious cultivation of the three brains.

The teachers of schools, colleges and universities, only address to the unfaithful memory of the bored students that wait with anxiety the hour to leave the classroom.

It is urgent, it is indispensable to know to combine intellect, movement and emotion with the purpose of taking integral information to the three brains of the students.

It turns out absurd to inform to only one brain. The first brain is not the only one of cognition. It turns out criminal to abuse of the thinking brain of the pupils.

The FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION will have to lead to the students by the path of the harmonious development.

The revolutionary psychology teaches clearly that the three brains have three kinds of independent associations totally different. These three kinds of associations evoke different types of impulses of the being.

This gives us in fact three different personalities that do not possess anything in common neither in its nature nor in its manifestations.

The revolutionary psychology of the new era teaches that in each person there exist three different psychological aspects. With one part of the psychic essence we wish a thing, with another part we wish something decidedly different and thanks to the third part we do something totally opposite.

In an instant of supreme pain, perhaps the loss of a loved being or any other intimate catastrophe, the emotional personality arrives until the desperation while the intellectual personality asks itself the because of all that tragedy and the personality of the movement only wants to flee of the scene.

These three different distinct personalities and many times even contradictory must be intelligently cultivated and instructed with methods and special systems in all the schools, colleges and universities.

From the psychological point of view it turns out absurd to educate exclusively to the intellectual personality. The man has three personalities that urgently need the FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.
