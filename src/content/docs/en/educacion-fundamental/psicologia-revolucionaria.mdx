Teachers and Lecturers in schools, colleges and universities should deeply study the REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY taught by the INTERNATIONAL GNOSTIC MOVEMENT.

The PSYCHOLOGY of the REVOLUTION underway is radically different from anything previously known by this name.

Beyond any doubt, we can say without fear of being wrong that in the course of the centuries that have preceded us, from the deep night of all ages, PSYCHOLOGY had never fallen as low as it currently has in this era of "REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE" and little gentlemen of ROCK.

The regressive and reactionary Psychology of these modern times, to top it all, has lamentably lost its sense of being, and all direct contact with its true origin.

In these times of sexual degeneration and total deterioration of the mind, it is not only impossible to define with meagre accuracy the term PSYCHOLOGY but also the fundamental subjects of Psychology are truly unknown.

Those who mistakenly assume that PSYCHOLOGY is a contemporary science of the latest hour are really confused because PSYCHOLOGY is an ancient science that has its origin in the old schools of the ARCHAIC MYSTERIES.

To the SNOB type, to the ultra-modern Rascal, to the reactionary, it is impossible to define what is known as PSYCHOLOGY because, with the exception of this contemporary era, it is obvious that PSYCHOLOGY never existed under its own name because for such and such reasons, it was always suspected of subversive tendencies of a political or religious nature and therefore saw the need to disguise itself with multiple garments.

From ancient times, in the different scenarios of the theatre of life, PSYCHOLOGY always played its role, intelligently disguised with the robe of philosophy.

On the banks of the Ganges, in the Sacred India of the VEDAS, from the terrifying night of the centuries, there are forms of YOGA that, in essence, are pure EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY, of high calibre.

The seven YOGAS have always been described as methods, procedures, or philosophical systems.

In the Arab world, the Sacred teachings of the SUFIS, partly metaphysical, partly Religious, are really of a totally PSYCHOLOGICAL order.

In old Europe, rotten to the core with so many wars, racial prejudices, religious, political etc. still until the end of the last century, PSYCHOLOGY disguised itself with the suit of Philosophy in order to go unnoticed.

Philosophy, despite all its divisions and subdivisions such as Logic, the theory of knowledge, Ethics, Aesthetics, etc., is beyond any doubt in itself, EVIDENT SELF-REFLECTION, MYSTICAL COGNITION OF BEING, COGNITIVE FUNCTIONALISM OF THE AWAKE CONSCIOUSNESS.

The error of many PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS lies in having considered psychology as something inferior to PHILOSOPHY, as something related only to the lowest and even trivial aspects of human nature.

A comparative study of Religions allows us to reach the logical conclusion that the SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY was always associated very closely with all RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES. Any comparative study of Religions demonstrates that in the most Orthodox SACRED LITERATURE of various countries and different eras, there are wonderful treasures of PSYCHOLOGICAL science.

In-depth research in the field of GNOSTICISM allows us to find that wonderful compilation of various Gnostic authors that comes from the early times of Christianity and is known under the title of PHILOKALIA, still used in our days in the EASTERN CHURCH, especially for the instruction of monks.

Beyond any doubt and without the slightest fear of falling into deception, we can emphatically affirm that PHILOKALIA is essentially PURE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.

In the ANCIENT SCHOOLS OF MYSTERIES of Greece, Egypt, Rome, India, Persia, Mexico, Peru, Assyria, Chaldea, etc. Etc. etc., PSYCHOLOGY was always linked to philosophy, to Real objective Art, to science and to Religion.

In ancient times PSYCHOLOGY was intelligently hidden among the graceful forms of the Sacred Dancers, or among the enigma of the strange Hieroglyphs or the beautiful sculptures, or in poetry, or in tragedy and even in the delicious music of the temples.

Before Science, Philosophy, Art and Religion separated to turn independently, PSYCHOLOGY reigned supreme in all the ANCIENT SCHOOLS OF MYSTERIES.

When the Initiatic Colleges closed due to the KALIYUGA, or DARK AGE in which we still are, PSYCHOLOGY survived among the symbolism of the various ESOTERIC and PSEUDO-ESOTERIC SCHOOLS of the MODERN WORLD and especially among GNOSTIC ESOTERICISM.

Deep analyses and in-depth research allow us to understand with all meridian clarity that the different Psychological systems and doctrines that existed in the past and that exist in the present can be divided into two categories.

First.- The doctrines as many intellectuals suppose them. Modern Psychology belongs in fact to this category.

Second.- The doctrines that study man from the point of view of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

These last are truly the original Doctrines, the oldest, only they allow us to understand the living origins of Psychology and its profound significance.

When we all have understood in an integral way and at all LEVELS OF THE MIND, how important is the study of man from the new point of view of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, we will then understand that Psychology is the study of the principles, laws and facts intimately related to the RADICAL and definitive TRANSFORMATION of the INDIVIDUAL.

It is urgent that Teachers and Lecturers in schools, colleges and universities fully understand the CRITICAL hour in which we live and the catastrophic state of Psychological disorientation in which the new Generation finds itself.

It is necessary to channel the "NEW WAVE" along the path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS and this is only possible through the REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.
