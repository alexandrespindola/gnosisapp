People confuse CONSCIOUSNESS with INTELLIGENCE or INTELLECT, and they give the very intelligent or intellectual person the qualification of very conscious.

We affirm that CONSCIOUSNESS in man is beyond any doubt and without fear of deceiving ourselves, a very particular kind of APPREHENSION OF INNER KNOWLEDGE totally independent of all mental activity.

The faculty of CONSCIOUSNESS allows us the knowledge of OURSELVES.

CONSCIOUSNESS gives us complete knowledge of what IS, of where it is, of what is really known, of what is certainly ignored.

REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY teaches that only man himself can come to know himself.

Only we can know if we are conscious at any given moment or not.

Only oneself can know of one's own consciousness and if it exists at any given moment or not.

Man himself and no one but him, can realise for an instant, for a moment that before that instant, before that moment, he was not really conscious, his consciousness was very asleep, then he will forget that experience or keep it as a memory, as the memory of a strong experience.

It is urgent to know that CONSCIOUSNESS in the RATIONAL ANIMAL is not something continuous, permanent.

Normally CONSCIOUSNESS in the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL called man, sleeps deeply.

Rare, very rare are the moments when CONSCIOUSNESS is awake; the intellectual animal works, drives cars, gets married, dies, etc. with the consciousness totally asleep and only in very exceptional moments awakens:

The life of the human being is a life of sleep, but he believes that he is awake and will never admit that he is dreaming, that his consciousness is asleep.

If someone were to wake up, they would feel frightfully ashamed with themselves, they would immediately understand their buffoonery, their ridiculousness.

This life is frightfully ridiculous, horribly tragic and rarely sublime.

If a boxer were to wake up immediately in the middle of a fight, he would look ashamed at all the honourable public and flee from the horrible spectacle, to the amazement of the sleeping and unconscious multitudes.

When the human being admits that he has SLEEPING CONSCIOUSNESS, you can be sure that he is already beginning to wake up.

The reactionary Schools of antiquated Psychology that deny the existence of CONSCIOUSNESS and even the uselessness of such a term, accuse the state of deepest sleep. The henchmen of such Schools sleep very deeply in a practically infraconscious and unconscious state.

Those who confuse consciousness with psychological functions; thoughts, feelings, motor impulses and sensations, are really very unconscious, they sleep deeply.

Those who admit the existence of CONSCIOUSNESS but flatly deny the different conscious degrees, accuse lack of conscious experience, sleep of consciousness.

Anyone who has ever awakened momentarily, knows very well from their own experience that there are different degrees of consciousness observable in oneself.

First Time. How long did we remain conscious?

Second Frequency. How many times have we awakened consciousness?

Third. AMPLITUDE AND PENETRATION. What will you be conscious of?

REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY and the ancient PHILOKALIA affirm that through great SUPER-EFFORTS of a very special type one can awaken consciousness and make it continuous and controllable.

The purpose of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS. Ten or fifteen years of studies at School, College and University are of no use, if when leaving the classrooms we are sleeping automatons.

It is no exaggeration to say that through some great EFFORT the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL can be conscious of itself for only a couple of minutes.

It is clear that in this there are usually rare exceptions today that we have to look for with Diogenes' lantern, those rare cases are represented by the TRUE MEN, BUDDHA, JESUS, HERMES, QUETZACOATL, etc.

These founders of RELIGIONS possessed CONTINUOUS CONSCIOUSNESS, they were great ILLUMINATED ONES.

Normally people are NOT conscious of themselves. The illusion of being continuously conscious arises from memory and all the processes of thought.

The man who practices a retrospective exercise to remember his whole life, can truly remember, recall how many times he married, how many children he fathered, who his parents were, his Teachers, etc., but this does not mean awakening consciousness, this is simply remembering unconscious acts and that is all.

It is necessary to repeat what we already said in previous chapters. There are four states of CONSCIOUSNESS. These are: SLEEP, state of WAKEFULNESS, SELF-Consciousness and OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

The poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL mistakenly called MAN, only lives in two of these states. One part of his life is spent in sleep and the other in the misnamed STATE OF WAKEFULNESS, which is also sleep.

The man who sleeps and is dreaming, believes that he awakens by the fact of returning to the state of wakefulness, but in reality during this state of wakefulness he continues to dream.

This is similar to dawn, the stars are hidden due to sunlight but they continue to exist even if the physical eyes do not perceive them.

In normal common and ordinary life the human being knows nothing of SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and much less of OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

However people are proud and everyone believes himself to be SELF-CONSCIOUS; the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL firmly believes that he is conscious of himself and will in no way accept being told that he is asleep and that he lives unconscious of himself.

There are exceptional moments in which the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL awakens, but those moments are very rare, they can be represented in an instant of supreme danger, during an intense emotion, in some new circumstance, in some new unexpected situation, etc.

It is truly a misfortune that the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL has no control over these fleeting states of consciousness, that he cannot evoke them, that he cannot make them continuous.

However, FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION affirms that man can ACHIEVE control of CONSCIOUSNESS and acquire SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.

REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY has scientific methods procedures to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS.

If we want to AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS we need to start by examining, studying and then eliminating all the obstacles that present themselves to us on the road, in this book we have taught the way to awaken CONSCIOUSNESS starting from the very benches of the School.
