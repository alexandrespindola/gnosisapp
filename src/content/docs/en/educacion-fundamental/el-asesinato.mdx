To kill is evidently and beyond any doubt, the most destructive and corrupting act known in the world.

The worst form of murder consists of destroying the lives of our fellow human beings.

Frightfully horrible is the hunter who with his shotgun murders the innocent creatures of the forest, but a thousand times more monstrous, a thousand times more abominable is he who murders his fellow human beings.

One does not only kill with machine guns, shotguns, cannons, pistols or atomic bombs, one can also kill with a look that wounds the heart, a humiliating look, a look full of contempt, a look full of hate; or one can kill with an ungrateful action, with a black action, or with an insult, or with a hurtful word.

The world is full of parricides, ungrateful matricides who have murdered their fathers and mothers, either with their looks, or with their words, or with their cruel actions.

The world is full of men who unknowingly have murdered their women and of women who unknowingly have murdered their husbands.

To top it all off in this cruel world in which we live, the human being kills what he loves the most.

Man does not live by bread alone, but also by different psychological factors.

There are many husbands who could have lived longer if their wives had allowed it.

There are many wives who could have lived longer if their husbands had allowed it.

There are many fathers and mothers who could have lived longer if their sons and daughters had allowed it.

The disease that takes our loved one to the grave has as its causa causorum, words that kill, looks that wound, ungrateful actions, etc.

This obsolete and degenerate society is full of unconscious murderers who presume to be innocent.

The prisons are full of murderers, but the worst kind of criminals presume to be innocent and walk free.

No form of murder can have any justification. Killing another does not solve any problem in life.

Wars have never solved any problem. Bombing defenseless cities and murdering millions of people solves nothing.

War is something too rude, coarse, monstrous, abominable. Millions of sleeping, unconscious, stupid human machines are launched into war with the purpose of destroying just as many millions of unconscious human machines.

Many times, a planetary catastrophe in the cosmos is enough, or a terrible position of the stars in the sky, for millions of men to launch themselves into war.

Human machines have no awareness of anything, they move in a destructive way when a certain type of cosmic wave secretly wounds them.

If people awakened their consciousness, if from the very benches of the School the students were wisely educated, leading them to the conscious understanding of what enmity and war are, it would be a different story, no one would launch themselves into war and the catastrophic waves of the cosmos would then be used in a different way.

War smells like cannibalism, like cave life, like bestiality of the worst kind, like bow, like arrow, like spear, like an orgy of blood, it is clearly incompatible with civilization.

All men in war are cowards, fearful, and the heroes loaded with medals are precisely the most cowardly, the most fearful.

The suicide also seems very brave, but he is a coward because he was afraid of life.

The hero deep down is a suicide who in an instant of supreme terror committed the madness of the suicide.

The madness of the suicide is easily confused with the valor of the hero.

If we carefully observe the behavior of the soldier during the war, his manners, his look, his words, his steps in the battle, we can evidence his total cowardice.

The Teachers of Schools, Colleges, Universities, must teach their students the truth about war. They must lead their students to consciously experience that Truth.

If people had full awareness of what this tremendous Truth of war is, if the Teachers knew how to wisely educate their disciples, no citizen would allow himself to be taken to the slaughterhouse.

Fundamental Education must be given right now in all Schools, Colleges and Universities, because it is precisely from the benches of the School, where one must work for PEACE.

It is urgent that the new Generations become fully aware of what barbarism is and what war is.

In Schools, Colleges, Universities, enmity and war must be understood in depth in all its aspects.

The new Generations must understand that the old with their stale and clumsy ideas, always sacrifice the young and take them like oxen to the slaughterhouse.

The young must not be convinced by warmongering propaganda, nor by the reasons of the old, because one reason is opposed by another reason and one opinion is opposed by another, but neither reasoning nor opinions are the Truth about War.

The old have thousands of reasons to justify war and take young people to the slaughterhouse.

The important thing is not the reasoning about war, but to experience the Truth of what war is.

We do not pronounce ourselves against Reason nor against analysis, we only want to say that we must first experience the truth about war and then we can afford the luxury of reasoning and analyzing.

It is impossible to experience the truth of DO NOT KILL, if we exclude deep intimate meditation.

Only very deep Meditation can lead us to experience the Truth about War.

Teachers must not only give intellectual information to their students. Teachers must teach their students to manage the mind, to experience the TRUTH.

This Obsolete and degenerate Race no longer thinks about anything but killing. This killing and killing is only typical of any degenerate human race.

Through television and cinema, the agents of crime propagate their criminal ideas.

The boys and girls of the new generation receive daily through the television screen and children's stories and cinema, magazines, etc., a good poisonous dose of murders, shootings, frightening crimes, etc.

You can no longer turn on the television without running into words full of hatred, gunshots, perversity.

The governments of the earth are doing nothing against the propagation of crime.

The minds of children and young people are being led by the agents of crime, down the path of crime.

The idea of killing is already so propagated, it is already so widespread through movies, stories, etc. that it has become totally familiar to everyone.

The rebels of the new wave have been educated for crime and kill for the pleasure of killing, they enjoy seeing others die. They learned it on the television at home, in the cinema, in stories, in magazines.

Crime reigns everywhere and governments do nothing to correct the instinct to kill from its very roots.

It is up to the Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities, to raise their voices to the heavens and stir heaven and earth to correct this mental epidemic.

It is urgent that the Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities, sound the alarm and ask all the governments of the earth for censorship for cinema, television, etc.

Crime is multiplying terribly due to all those spectacles of blood and at the rate we are going the day will come when no one will be able to circulate freely through the streets without the fear of being murdered.

Radio, Cinema, Television, Blood Magazines, have given such propagation of the crime of killing, they have made it so pleasant to weak and degenerate minds, that no one is tempted in their heart to put a bullet or a stab wound into another person.

By dint of so much propagation of the crime of killing, weak minds have become too familiar with crime and now they even indulge in killing to imitate what they saw in the cinema or on television.

Teachers who are the educators of the people are obliged in fulfillment of their duty to fight for the new generations by asking the Governments of the earth to prohibit spectacles of blood, in short, the cancellation of all kinds of films about murders, thieves, etc.

The struggle of Teachers must also extend to bullfighting and boxing.

The type of the bullfighter is the most cowardly and criminal type. The bullfighter wants all the advantages for himself and kills to amuse the public.

The type of the boxer is that of the murder monster, in his sadistic form that wounds and kills to amuse the public.

This kind of spectacle of blood is barbaric in a hundred percent and stimulates minds leading them down the path of crime. If we really want to fight for the Peace of the World, we must initiate a fundamental campaign against spectacles of blood.

While destructive factors exist within the human mind there will inevitably be wars.

Within the human mind exist the factors that produce war, those factors are hatred, violence in all its aspects, selfishness, anger, fear, criminal instincts, warmongering ideas propagated by television, radio, cinema, etc.

Propaganda for PEACE, the NOBEL PEACE PRIZES are absurd while the Psychological factors that produce war exist within man.

Currently many murderers have the NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.
