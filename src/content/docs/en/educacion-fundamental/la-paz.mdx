PEACE cannot come through the MIND because it is not of the Mind. PEACE is the delicious perfume of the QUIET HEART.

PEACE is not a matter of projects, international police, the UN, the OAS, international treaties, or invading armies fighting in the name of PEACE.

If we truly want real PEACE, we must learn to live like the watchman in wartime, always alert and vigilant, with a ready and flexible Mind, because PEACE is not a matter of romantic FANTASIES or beautiful dreams.

If we do not learn to live in a state of alertness from moment to moment, then the path that leads to PEACE becomes impossible, narrow, and after becoming extremely difficult, it will ultimately lead to a dead end.

It is necessary to understand, it is urgent to know that the authentic PEACE of the QUIET HEART is not a house where we can arrive and where a beautiful maiden awaits us happily. PEACE is not a goal, a place, etc.

Pursuing PEACE, seeking it, making projects about it, fighting in its name, making propaganda about it, founding organizations to work for it, etc., is totally absurd because PEACE is not of the Mind, PEACE is the marvelous perfume of the quiet heart.

PEACE cannot be bought or sold nor can it be achieved with the system of APPEASEMENTS, special controls, police, etc.

In some countries the national army goes through the countryside destroying towns, murdering people, and shooting alleged bandits, all this supposedly in the name of PEACE. The result of such a procedure is the multiplication of BARBARITY.

Violence begets more violence, hatred produces more hatred. PEACE cannot be conquered, PEACE cannot be the result of violence. PEACE only comes to us when we dissolve the EGO, when we destroy within ourselves all the PSYCHOLOGICAL factors that produce wars.

If we want PEACE we have to contemplate, we have to study, we have to see, the total picture and not just a corner of it.

PEACE is born in us when we have changed radically in an intimate way.

The issue of controls, PRO PEACE organizations, appeasements, etc., are isolated details, points, in the ocean of life, isolated fractions of the total picture of EXISTENCE, which can never solve the problem of PEACE in its radical, total, and definitive form.

We must look at the picture in its complete form, the problem of the world is the problem of the individual; if the INDIVIDUAL does not have PEACE within, society, the world will inevitably live in war.

The teachers in schools, colleges, universities must work for PEACE, unless they love BARBARITY and VIOLENCE.

It is urgent, it is indispensable to point out to the students of the new generation the course to follow, the intimate path that can lead us with complete accuracy to the authentic PEACE of the quiet heart.

People do not know how to really understand what true inner PEACE is and only want no one to get in their way, not to be hindered, not to be bothered, even when they take on their own account and risk the right to hinder and bother and embitter the lives of their fellow human beings.

People have never experienced true PEACE and only have absurd opinions, romantic ideals, and mistaken concepts about it.

For thieves, PEACE would be the joy of being able to steal with impunity without the police getting in their way. For smugglers, PEACE would be being able to bring their contraband everywhere without the authorities preventing them. For those who starve the people, PEACE would be selling very dearly, exploiting right and left without the official government inspectors prohibiting it. For prostitutes, PEACE would be enjoying themselves in their beds of pleasure and exploiting all men freely without the health or police authorities intervening in their lives at all.

Each one forms in their mind fifty thousand absurd fantasies about PEACE. Each one intends to raise around them a selfish wall of false ideas, beliefs, opinions, and absurd concepts about what PEACE is.

Each one wants PEACE in their own way, according to their whims, their tastes, their habits, mistaken customs, etc. Each one wants to lock themselves inside a protective, fantastic wall, with the purpose of living their own PEACE, mistakenly conceived.

People fight for PEACE, they desire it, they want it, but they do not know what PEACE is. People only want not to be hindered, to be able to do each one their mischief very quietly and at their leisure. That is what they call PEACE.

No matter what mischief people do, each one believes that what they do is good. People find justification even for the worst crimes. If the drunkard is sad he drinks because he is sad. If the drunkard is happy he drinks because he is happy. The drunkard always justifies the vice of alcohol. That is how all people are, for every crime they find justification, no one considers themselves perverse, everyone presumes to be just and honorable.

There are many vagabonds who mistakenly assume that PEACE is being able to live without working, very quietly and without any effort in a world full of wonderful romantic fantasies.

About PEACE there are millions of mistaken opinions and concepts. In this painful world in which we live: each one seeks their fantastic PEACE, the peace of their opinions. People want to see in the world the peace of their dreams, their special type of peace, even though within themselves each one carries within them the psychological factors that produce wars, enmities, problems of all kinds.

In these times of global crisis everyone who wants to become famous founds PRO-PEACE organizations, makes propaganda, and becomes a champion of PEACE. We must not forget that many cunning politicians have won the NOBEL PEACE prize even though they have a whole cemetery on their account and that in one way or another they have secretly ordered the assassination of many people, when they have seen themselves in danger of being eclipsed.

There are also true teachers of humanity who sacrifice themselves by teaching in all places of the earth the Doctrine of the Dissolution of the EGO. These teachers know from their own experience that only by dissolving the Mephistopheles that we carry within, does the peace of the heart come to us.

As long as hatred, greed, envy, jealousy, the acquisitive spirit, ambition, anger, pride, etc. exist within each individual, there will inevitably be wars.

We know many people in the world who presume to have found PEACE. When we have studied these people in depth, we have been able to evidence that they do not remotely know PEACE and that they have only locked themselves within some solitary and comforting habit, or within some special belief, etc., but really these people have not experienced even remotely what the true PEACE of the quiet heart is. Really these poor people have only fabricated an artificial peace that in their ignorance they confuse with the AUTHENTIC PEACE OF THE HEART.

It is absurd to seek PEACE within the mistaken walls of our prejudices, beliefs, preconceptions, desires, habits, etc.

As long as the psychological factors that produce enmities, dissensions, problems, wars exist within the Mind, there will be no true PEACE.

Authentic PEACE comes from legitimately, wisely understood beauty.

The beauty of the quiet heart exhales the delicious perfume of true inner PEACE.

It is urgent to understand the beauty of friendship and the perfume of courtesy.

It is urgent to understand the beauty of language. It is necessary that our words carry within themselves the substance of sincerity. We must never use arrhythmic, inharmonious, rude, absurd words.

Each word should be a true symphony, each phrase should be full of spiritual beauty. It is as bad to speak when one should be silent, and to be silent when one should speak. There are criminal silences and there are infamous words.

There are times when speaking is a crime, there are times when being silent is also another crime. One must speak when one must speak and be silent when one must be silent.

Let us not play with the word because it carries grave responsibility.

Every word must be weighed before being articulated because each word can produce much that is useful and much that is useless, much benefit or much harm in the world.

We must take care of our gestures, manners, clothing, and acts of all kinds. May our gestures, our clothing, the way we sit at the table, the way we behave when eating, the way we attend to people in the room, in the office, in the street, etc. be always full of beauty and harmony.

It is necessary to understand the beauty of kindness, to feel the beauty of good music, to love the beauty of creative art, to refine our way of thinking, feeling, and acting.

Supreme beauty can only be born in us when the EGO has died in a radical, total, and definitive way.

We are ugly, horrible, disgusting as long as we have the PSYCHOLOGICAL EGO inside and very alive. Beauty in its entirety is impossible in us as long as the PLURALIZED EGO exists.

If we want authentic PEACE, we must reduce the EGO to cosmic dust. Only then will there be inner beauty in us. From that beauty will be born in us the enchantment of love and the true PEACE of the heart.

CREATIVE PEACE brings order within oneself, eliminates confusion, and fills us with legitimate happiness.

It is necessary to know that the mind cannot understand what true PEACE is. It is urgent to understand that the peace of the quiet heart does not come to us through effort, or by belonging to some society or organization dedicated to making propaganda of PEACE.

Authentic peace comes to us in a totally natural and simple way when we reconquer innocence in the mind and in the heart, when we become like delicate and beautiful children, sensitive to everything beautiful as to everything ugly, to everything good as to everything bad, to everything sweet as to everything bitter.

It is necessary to reconquer lost childhood, both in the mind and in the heart.

PEACE is something immense, extensive, infinite, it is not something formed by the mind, it cannot be the result of a whim nor the product of an idea. Peace is an atomic substance that is beyond good and evil, a substance that is beyond all morality, a substance that emanates from the very bowels of the ABSOLUTE.
