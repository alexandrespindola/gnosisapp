In the world there are many speakers who amaze with their eloquence, but few people know how to listen.

Knowing how to listen is very difficult, few people truly know how to listen.

WHEN THE TEACHER speaks, the lecturer, the speaker, the audience seems to be very attentive, as if following in detail each word of the speaker, everything gives the idea that they are listening, that they are in a state of alert, but deep in the psychological background of each individual there is a secretary who translates each word of the speaker.

THIS SECRETARY IS THE I, THE MYSELF, THE SELF. The work of this secretary consists of misinterpreting, mistranslating the words of the speaker.

THE I translates according to its prejudices, preconceptions, fears, pride, anxieties, ideas, memories, etc., etc., etc.

The students in the school, the individuals who together constitute the audience that listens, are not really listening to the speaker, they are listening to themselves, they are listening to their own EGO, to their beloved MACHIAVELLIAN EGO, which is not willing to accept what is REAL, what is TRUE, what is ESSENTIAL.

Only in a state of NOVELTY alertness, with a SPONTANEOUS MIND free from the weight of the past, in a state of full RECEPTIVITY, can we really listen without the intervention of that terrible secretary of ill omen called I, MYSELF, SELF, EGO.

When the mind is conditioned by memory, it only repeats what it has accumulated.

The mind conditioned by the experiences of so many yesterdays, can only see the present through the murky lenses of the past.

IF WE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO LISTEN, if we want to learn to listen to discover the new, we must live according to the philosophy of MOMENTARINESS.

It is urgent to live from moment to moment without the worries of the past, and without the projects of the future.

TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment, our minds must always be alert, in full attention, free of prejudices, preconceptions, in order to be truly receptive.

School teachers should teach their students the profound significance that is enclosed in knowing how to listen.

It is necessary to learn to live wisely, reaffirm our senses, refine our behavior, our thoughts, our feelings.

It is useless to have a great academic culture, if we do not know how to listen, if we are not capable of discovering the new from moment to moment.

We need to refine attention, refine our manners, refine our persons, things, etc., etc., etc.

It is impossible to be truly refined when we do not know how to listen.

Crude, rough, deteriorated, degenerate minds never know how to listen, they never know how to discover the new, those Minds only understand, they only understand in an erroneous way the absurd translations of that satanic secretary called I, MYSELF, EGO.

Being refined is something very difficult and requires full attention. Someone can be a very refined person in fashions, suits, dresses, gardens, automobiles, friendships, and yet continue in the intimate being rude, rough, heavy.

Whoever knows how to live from moment to moment, really marches on the path of true refinement.

Whoever has a receptive, spontaneous, complete, alert Mind, walks the path of authentic refinement.

Whoever opens himself to everything new abandoning the weight of the past, the preconceptions, the prejudices, suspicions, fanaticism, etc., marches triumphantly on the path of legitimate refinement.

The degenerate mind lives bottled up in the past, in preconceptions, pride, self-love, prejudices, etc., etc.

The degenerate mind does not know how to see the new, does not know how to listen, it is conditioned by SELF-LOVE.

The fanatics of MARXISM-LENINISM do not accept the new; they do not admit the fourth CHARACTERISTIC of all things, the fourth DIMENSION, out of self-love, they love themselves too much, they cling to their own absurd materialist theories and When we place them in the field of concrete facts, when we demonstrate the absurdity of their sophisms, they raise their left arm, look at the hands of their wristwatch, give an evasive excuse and leave.

Those are degenerate minds, decrepit minds that do not know how to listen, that do not know how to discover the new, that do not accept reality because they are bottled up in SELF-LOVE. Minds that love themselves too much, minds that do not know about CULTURAL REFINEMENTS, crude minds, rough minds, that only listen to their beloved EGO.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION teaches to listen, teaches to live wisely.

Teachers in schools, colleges, universities should teach their students the authentic path of true vital refinement.

It is useless to remain ten and fifteen years stuck in schools, colleges and universities, if upon leaving we are internally true pigs in our thoughts, ideas, feelings and customs.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is needed urgently because the new generations signify the beginning of a new era.

The hour of the TRUE REVOLUTION has arrived, the moment of the FUNDAMENTAL REVOLUTION has arrived.

The past is the past and has already borne fruit. We need to understand the deep significance of the moment in which we live.
