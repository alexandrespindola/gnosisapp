In the world, there are many speakers who astonish with their eloquence, but few people know how to listen.

Knowing how to listen is very difficult, few people truly know how to listen.

WHEN THE TEACHER, the lecturer, the speaker, is talking, the audience seems very attentive, as if following every word of the speaker in detail, everything gives the impression that they are listening, that they are in a state of alert, but deep down in the psychological background of each individual there is a secretary who translates each word of the speaker.

THIS SECRETARY IS THE I, THE ME, THE SELF. The job of this secretary is to misinterpret, to mistranslate the words of the speaker.

THE I translates according to its prejudices, preconceptions, fears, pride, anxieties, ideas, memories, etc., etc., etc.

The pupils at school, the individuals who together make up the audience that listens, are not really listening to the speaker, they are listening to themselves, they are listening to their own EGO, to their dear MACHIAVELLIAN EGO, which is not willing to accept what is REAL, what is TRUE, what is ESSENTIAL.

Only in a state of alert NOVELTY, with a SPONTANEOUS MIND free from the weight of the past, in a state of full RECEPTIVITY, can we really listen without the intervention of that terrible ill-omened secretary called I, ME, SELF, EGO.

When the mind is conditioned by memory, it only repeats what it has accumulated.

The Mind conditioned by the experiences of so many yesterdays, can only see the present through the cloudy lenses of the past.

IF WE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO LISTEN, if we want to learn to listen to discover the new, we must live according to the philosophy of MOMENTARINESS.

It is urgent to live from moment to moment without the worries of the past, and without the plans of the future.

The TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment, our minds must always be alert, in full attention, free from prejudices, preconceptions, in order to be truly receptive.

School Teachers must teach their pupils the profound significance of knowing how to listen.

It is necessary to learn to live wisely, to reaffirm our senses, to refine our behaviour, our thoughts, our feelings.

It is useless to have a great academic culture if we do not know how to listen, if we are not capable of discovering the new from moment to moment.

We need to refine attention, refine our manners, refine our persons, things, etc., etc., etc.

It is impossible to be truly refined when we do not know how to listen.

Crude, rough, deteriorated, degenerate Minds never know how to listen, they never know how to discover the new, those Minds only understand, only understand in a misguided way the absurd translations of that satanic secretary called I, ME, EGO.

Being refined is very difficult and requires full attention. Someone can be a very refined person in fashion, suits, dresses, gardens, automobiles, friendships, and yet continue to be rude, coarse, heavy in their intimate being.

Whoever knows how to live from moment to moment, really walks the path of true refinement.

Whoever has a receptive, spontaneous, integral, alert Mind, walks along the path of authentic refinement.

Whoever opens themselves to all that is new, abandoning the weight of the past, preconceptions, prejudices, suspicions, fanaticisms, etc., marches triumphantly along the path of legitimate refinement.

The degenerate mind lives bottled up in the past, in preconceptions, pride, self-love, prejudices, etc., etc.

The degenerate mind does not know how to see the new, does not know how to listen, it is conditioned by SELF-LOVE.

The fanatics of MARXISM-LENINISM do not accept the new; they do not admit the fourth CHARACTERISTIC of all things, the fourth DIMENSION, out of self-love, they love themselves too much, they cling to their own absurd materialistic theories and When we place them on the ground of concrete facts, when we demonstrate to them the absurdity of their sophisms, they raise their left arm, look at the hands of their wristwatch, give an evasive excuse and leave.

Those are degenerate minds, decrepit minds that do not know how to listen, that do not know how to discover the new, that do not accept reality because they are bottled up in SELF-LOVE. Minds that love themselves too much, minds that do not know about CULTURAL REFINEMENTS, crude minds, rough minds, that only listen to their dear EGO.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION teaches to listen, teaches to live wisely.

The teachers of schools, colleges, universities must teach their pupils the authentic path of true vital refinement.

It is useless to remain ten and fifteen years locked in schools, colleges and universities, if when we leave we are internally true pigs in our thoughts, ideas, feelings and customs.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION is needed urgently because the new generations signify the beginning of a new era.

The hour of the TRUE REVOLUTION has arrived, the moment of the FUNDAMENTAL REVOLUTION has arrived.

The past is the past and has already borne its fruits. We need to understand the deep significance of the moment in which we live.
