Fundamental EDUCATION, in its true sense, is a deep understanding of oneself; within each individual lie all the laws of nature.

He who wishes to know all the wonders of nature must study them within himself.

False Education only cares about enriching the intellect, and anyone can do that. It is obvious that with money, anyone can afford to buy books.

We do not speak against intellectual culture, we only speak against the exorbitant mental accumulation drive.

False intellectual education only offers subtle escapes to flee from oneself.

Every erudite man, every intellectual vice, always has wonderful evasions that allow him to flee from himself.

From INTELLECTUALISM without SPIRITUALITY result SCOUNDRELS, and these have led humanity to CHAOS and DESTRUCTION.

Technique can never enable us to know ourselves in an INTEGRAL UNI-TOTAL way.

Parents send their children to school, college, university, polytechnic, etc., to learn some technique, to have some profession, so that they can finally earn a living.

It is obvious that we need to know some technique, to have a profession, but that is secondary, the primary, the fundamental, is to know ourselves, to know who we are, where we come from, where we are going, what is the purpose of our existence.

In life there is everything, joys, sorrows, love, passion, joy, pain, beauty, ugliness, etc., and when we know how to live it intensely, when we understand it on all LEVELS of the mind, we find our place in society, we create our own technique, our particular way of living, feeling and thinking, but the opposite is one hundred percent false, the technique by itself can never originate deep understanding, true understanding.

Current education has been a resounding failure because it gives EXAGGERATED importance to technique, to profession, and it is obvious that by emphasising technique, it turns man into a mechanical automaton, destroying his best possibilities.

Cultivating capacity and efficiency without understanding life, without knowledge of oneself, without a direct perception of the process of MYSELF, without a careful study of one's own way of thinking, feeling, desiring and acting, will only serve to increase our own cruelty, our own selfishness, those Psychological factors that produce war, hunger, misery, pain.

The exclusive development of technology has produced Mechanics, Scientists, technicians, atomic physicists, vivisectors of poor animals, inventors of destructive weapons, etc., etc., etc.

All those professionals, all those inventors of Atomic Bombs and Hydrogen Bombs, all those vivisectors who torment the creatures of nature, all those scoundrels, are only really good for war and destruction.

All those scoundrels know nothing, they understand nothing of the total process of life in all its infinite manifestations.

General technological progress, transport systems, counting machines, electric lighting, elevators inside buildings, electronic brains of all kinds, etc., solve thousands of problems that are processed at the superficial level of existence, but introduces into the individual and into society, a multitude of broader and deeper problems.

Living exclusively on the SUPERFICIAL LEVEL without taking into account the different terrains and deeper regions of the mind, means in fact attracting upon ourselves and upon our children, misery, tears and despair.

The greatest need, the most urgent problem of each INDIVIDUAL, of each person, is to understand life in its INTEGRAL, UNITOTAL form, because only in this way are we in a position to satisfactorily solve all our intimate particular problems.

Technical knowledge by itself can never solve all our Psychological problems, all our deep complexes.

If we want to be real MEN, INTEGRAL INDIVIDUALS, we must SELF-EXPLORE PSYCHOLOGICALLY, know ourselves deeply in all the territories of thought, because TECHNOLOGY without a doubt, becomes a destructive instrument, when we do not TRULY UNDERSTAND the entire total process of existence, when we do not know ourselves in an INTEGRAL way.

If the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL truly loved, if he knew himself, if he had understood the total process of life he would never have committed the CRIME of FRACTURING the ATOM.

Our technical progress is fantastic but it has only managed to increase our aggressive power to destroy each other and everywhere reign terror, hunger, ignorance and disease.

No profession, no technique can ever give us that which is called FULFILLMENT, TRUE HAPPINESS.

Everyone in life suffers intensely in their trade, in their profession, in their routine way of life, and things and occupations become instruments of envy, murmuring, hatred, bitterness.

The world of doctors, the world of artists, of engineers, of lawyers, etc., each of those worlds, is full of pain, murmuring, competition, envy, etc.

Without the understanding of ourselves, mere occupation, trade or profession, leads us to pain and the search for evasions. Some seek escapes through alcohol, the canteen, the tavern, the cabaret, others want to escape through drugs, morphine, cocaine, marijuana, and others through lust and sexual degeneration, etc., etc.

When you want to reduce all of LIFE to a technique, to a profession, to a system for earning money and more money, the result is boredom, annoyance and the search for evasions.

We must become INTEGRAL, complete INDIVIDUALS, and that is only possible by knowing ourselves and dissolving the PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION, while stimulating the learning of a technique to earn a living, must do something of greater importance, it must help man to experience, to feel in all its aspects and in all the territories of the mind, the process of existence.

If someone has something to say, let them say it, and saying it is very interesting because that way each one creates their own style, but learning foreign styles without having directly experienced life in its INTEGRAL form, only leads to superficiality.
