Fundamental EDUCATION in its true sense is the profound understanding of oneself; within each individual are found all the laws of nature.

He who wishes to know all the wonders of nature must study them within himself.

False education is only concerned with enriching the intellect, and anyone can do that. It is obvious that with money, anyone can afford to buy books.

We do not speak out against intellectual culture, we only speak out against the exorbitant mental accumulation.

False intellectual education only offers subtle escapes to flee from oneself.

Every erudite man, every intellectual vice, always has wonderful evasions that allow him to flee from himself.

From INTELLECTUALISM without SPIRITUALITY come the SCOUNDRELS, and these have led humanity to CHAOS and DESTRUCTION.

Technique can never enable us to know ourselves in a COMPLETE UNI-TOTAL way.

Parents send their children to school, college, university, polytechnic, etc., to learn some technique, to have some profession, so that they can finally earn a living.

It is obvious that we need to know some technique, to have a profession, but that is secondary, the primary, the fundamental thing, is to know ourselves, to know who we are, where we come from, where we are going, what is the object of our existence.

In life there is everything, joys, sorrows, love, passion, joy, pain, beauty, ugliness, etc., and when we know how to live it intensely, when we understand it on all LEVELS of the mind, we find our place in society, we create our own technique, our particular way of living, feeling and thinking, but the opposite is one hundred percent false, the technique by itself, can never originate the deep understanding, the true understanding.

The current education has been a resounding failure because it gives EXAGGERATED importance to technique, to profession and it is obvious that by underlining the technique, it turns man into a mechanical automaton, destroys his best possibilities.

Cultivating capacity and efficiency without the understanding of life, without the knowledge of oneself, without a direct perception of the process of MYSELF, without a detailed study of one's own way of thinking, feeling, desiring and acting, will only serve to increase our own cruelty, our own selfishness, those Psychological factors that produce war, hunger, misery, pain.

The exclusive development of the technique has produced Mechanics, Scientists, technicians, atomic physicists, vivisectors of poor animals, inventors of destructive weapons, etc., etc., etc.

All those professionals, all those inventors of Atomic Bombs and Hydrogen Bombs, all those vivisectors who torment the creatures of nature, all those scoundrels, the only thing they are really good for is war and destruction.

All those scoundrels know nothing, they understand nothing of the total process of life in all its infinite manifestations.

The general technological progress, transport systems, counting machines, electric lighting, elevators inside buildings, electronic brains of all kinds, etc., solve thousands of problems that are processed at the superficial level of existence, but introduce into the individual and into society, a multitude of broader and deeper problems.

Living exclusively on the SUPERFICIAL LEVEL without taking into account the different terrains and deeper regions of the mind, means in fact attracting upon ourselves and upon our children, misery, weeping and despair.

The greatest need, the most urgent problem of each INDIVIDUAL, of each person, is to understand life in its INTEGRAL, UNITOTAL form, because only then are we in a position to satisfactorily solve all our intimate particular problems.

Technical knowledge by itself can never solve all our Psychological problems, all our deep complexes.

If we want to be true MEN, INTEGRAL INDIVIDUALS we must SELF-EXPLORE PSYCHOLOGICALLY, know ourselves deeply in all the territories of thought, because TECHNOLOGY beyond any doubt, becomes a destructive instrument, when we do not TRULY UNDERSTAND the entire total process of existence, when we do not know ourselves in an INTEGRAL way.

If the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL truly loved, if he knew himself, if he had understood the total process of life, he would never have committed the CRIME of FRACTIONATING the ATOM.

Our technical progress is fantastic but it has only managed to increase our aggressive power to destroy each other and everywhere reign terror, hunger, ignorance and disease.

No profession, no technique can ever give us that which is called FULLNESS, TRUE HAPPINESS.

Each one in life suffers intensely in his trade, in his profession, in his routine way of life and things and occupations become instruments of envy, murmuring, hatred, bitterness.

The world of doctors, the world of artists, of engineers, of lawyers, etc., each of those worlds, is full of pain, murmurings, competition, envy, etc.

Without the understanding of ourselves the mere occupation, trade or profession, leads us to pain and the search for evasions. Some seek escapes through alcohol the canteen, the tavern, the cabaret, others want to escape through drugs, morphine, cocaine, marijuana and others through lust and sexual degeneration, etc., etc.

When one wants to reduce all LIFE to a technique, to a profession, to a system for earning money and more money, the result is boredom, annoyance and the search for evasions.

We must become INTEGRAL, complete INDIVIDUALS and that is only possible by knowing ourselves and dissolving the PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF.

FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION at the same time that it stimulates the learning of a technique to earn a living, must do something of greater importance, must help man, to experience, to feel in all its aspects and in all the territories of the mind, the process of existence.

If someone has something to say, let him say it and that of saying it is very interesting because thus each one creates for himself his own style, but learns foreign styles without having directly experienced life in its INTEGRAL form; it only leads to superficiality.
