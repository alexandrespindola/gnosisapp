The first forty years of life give us the text; the next thirty, the commentary.

At twenty years old, a man is a peacock; at thirty, a lion; at forty, a camel; at fifty, a snake; at sixty, a dog; at seventy, a monkey, and at eighty, only a voice and a shadow.

Time reveals all things: it is a most interesting charlatan who speaks for himself even when he is not being asked anything.

There is nothing made by the hand of the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL, falsely called man, that sooner or later time does not destroy.

"FUGIT IRRÃ‰PARABILE TEMPUS", time that flees cannot be repaired.

Time brings to public light everything that is now hidden, and covers and hides everything that at this moment shines with splendour.

Old age is like love, it cannot be hidden even when disguised in the garments of youth.

Old age defeats the pride of men and humiliates them, but it is one thing to be humble and another to fall humiliated.

When death approaches, the old, disappointed with life, find that old age is no longer a burden.

All men harbour the hope of living a long life and becoming old, and yet old age frightens them.

Old age begins at fifty-six years and then proceeds in septennial periods that lead us to decrepitude and death.

The greatest tragedy of the old lies, not in the very fact of being old, but in the foolishness of not wanting to recognise that they are, and in the stupidity of believing themselves young as if old age were a crime.

The best thing about old age is that one is very close to the finish line.

The PSYCHOLOGICAL I, the MYSELF, the EGO, does not improve with the years and experience; it becomes complicated, more difficult, more laborious, hence the popular saying: "LEOPARD NEVER CHANGES ITS SPOTS".

The PSYCHOLOGICAL I of difficult old people comforts itself by giving beautiful advice due to its inability to set bad examples.

Old people know very well that old age is a very terrible tyrant who forbids them, on pain of death, to enjoy the pleasures of wild youth, and prefer to console themselves by giving beautiful advice.

The I hides the I, the I hides a part of itself, and everything is labelled with sublime phrases and beautiful advice.

ONE part of MYSELF hides another part of MYSELF. The I hides what is not convenient for it.

It is completely demonstrated by observation and experience that when vices abandon us, we like to think that we were the ones who abandoned them.

The heart of the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL does not become better with the years, but worse, it always turns to stone, and if in youth we were greedy, liars, irascible, in old age we will be much more so.

Old people live in the past, old people are the result of many yesterdays, the elderly completely ignore the moment in which we live, old people are accumulated memory.

The only way to reach perfect old age is by dissolving the PSYCHOLOGICAL I. When we learn to die from moment to moment, we reach sublime old age.

Old age has a great sense of peace and freedom for those who have already dissolved the I.

When passions have died in a radical, total and definitive way, one is free not from one master, but from many masters.

It is very difficult to find in life innocent elders who no longer possess even the remnants of the I; that kind of elders are infinitely happy and live from instant to instant.

The man greyed in WISDOM. The elder in knowledge, the lord of love, becomes in fact the beacon of light that wisely guides the current of the innumerable centuries.

In the world there have existed and currently exist some ELDER MASTERS who do not even have the last remnants of the I. These GNOSTIC ARHATS are as exotic and divine as the lotus flower.

THE VENERABLE ELDER MASTER who has dissolved the PLURALISED I in a radical and definitive way is the perfect expression of PERFECT WISDOM, DIVINE LOVE AND SUBLIME POWER.

THE ELDER MASTER who no longer has the I, is in fact the full manifestation of the DIVINE BEING.

Those SUBLIME ELDERS, those GNOSTIC ARHATS have illuminated the world since ancient times, let us remember the BUDDHA, MOSES, HERMES, RAMARKRISHNA, DANIEL, THE HOLY LAMA, etc., etc., etc.

School, college and university teachers, female teachers, parents, should teach new generations to respect and venerate the elderly.

THAT which has no name, THAT which is DIVINE, THAT which is REAL, has three aspects: WISDOM, LOVE, WORD.

THE DIVINE as FATHER is COSMIC WISDOM, as MOTHER is INFINITE LOVE, as son is the WORD.

In the father of the family is found the symbol of wisdom. In the mother of the home is found LOVE, the children symbolise the word.

The elderly Father deserves all the support of the children. The Father, already old, cannot work and it is fair that the children maintain and respect him.

The Adorable Mother, already elderly, cannot work and therefore it is necessary that the sons and daughters look after her and love her and make that love a religion.

Whoever does not know how to love his Father, whoever does not know how to ADORE his MOTHER, marches on the path of the left hand, on the path of error.

Children have no right to judge their Parents, no one is perfect in this world and those of us who do not have certain defects in one direction, have them in another, we are all cut from the same cloth.

Some underestimate PATERNAL LOVE, others even laugh at PATERNAL LOVE. Those who behave like this in life have not even entered the path that leads to THAT which has no name.

The ungrateful son who hates his Father and forgets his Mother is really the true perverse one who hates everything that is DIVINE.

THE REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS does not mean INGRATITUDE, forgetting the father, underestimating the adorable Mother. THE REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS is WISDOM LOVE and PERFECT POWER.

In the Father is found the symbol of wisdom and in the Mother is found the living source of LOVE without whose purest essence it is really impossible to achieve the highest INTIMATE REALISATIONS.
