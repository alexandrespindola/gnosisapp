Ambition has several causes, and one of them is what is called FEAR.

The humble boy who shines the shoes of proud gentlemen in the parks of luxurious cities could become a thief if he were to feel fear of poverty, fear of himself, fear of his future.

The humble seamstress who works in the lavish department store of the potentate could become a thief or prostitute overnight if she were to feel fear of the future, fear of life, fear of old age, fear of herself, etc.

The elegant waiter in the luxury restaurant or grand hotel could become a GANSTER, a bank robber, or a very refined thief, if unfortunately he were to feel fear of himself, of his humble position as a waiter, of his own future, etc.

The insignificant insect aspires to be elegant. The poor counter clerk who serves customers and patiently shows us the tie, the shirt, the shoes, making many bows and smiling with feigned meekness, aspires to something more because he is afraid, very afraid, afraid of misery, afraid of his bleak future, afraid of old age, etc.

AMBITION is multifaceted. AMBITION has the face of a saint and the face of a devil, the face of a man and the face of a woman, the face of interest and the face of disinterest, the face of a virtuous person and the face of a sinner.

There is AMBITION in the one who wants to marry and in that OLD confirmed BACHELOR who abhors marriage.

There is AMBITION in the one who desperately wants "TO BE SOMEONE", "TO STAND OUT", "TO CLIMB" and there is AMBITION in the one who becomes an ANACHORET, who wants nothing of this world, because his only AMBITION is to reach HEAVEN, TO LIBERATE himself, etc.

There are EARTHLY AMBITIONS and SPIRITUAL AMBITIONS. Sometimes AMBITION wears the mask of DISINTEREST and SACRIFICE.

He who does not ASPIRE to this wretched and MISERABLE world, ASPIRES to the other, and he who does not ASPIRE to money, ASPIRES to PSYCHIC POWERS.

The EGO, the MYSELF, the SELF, loves to hide AMBITION, put it in the most secret recesses of the mind and then says: "I DO NOT ASPIRE TO ANYTHING", "I LOVE MY FELLOW MEN", "I WORK SELFLESSLY FOR THE GOOD OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS".

The FOX POLITICIAN, who knows it all, sometimes amazes the crowds with his apparently selfless works, but when he leaves the job, it is only normal for him to leave his country with a few million dollars.

AMBITION disguised with the MASK OF DISINTEREST, usually deceives the most astute people.

There are many people in the world who only ASPIRE not to be AMBITIOUS.

There are many people who renounce all the pomp and vanities of the world because they only ASPIRE to their own INTIMATE SELF-PERFECTION.

The penitent who walks on his knees to the temple and who flagellates himself full of faith, apparently aspires to nothing and even gives himself the luxury of giving without taking anything from anyone, but it is clear that he ASPIRES to the MIRACLE, healing, health for himself or for some family member, or else, eternal salvation.

We admire truly religious men and women, but we regret that they do not love their religion with complete DISINTEREST.

Holy religions, sublime sects, orders, spiritual societies, etc. Deserve our DISINTERESTED LOVE.

It is very rare to find in this world someone who loves his religion, his school, his sect, etc. selflessly. That is regrettable.

The whole world is full of ambitions. Hitler launched into war out of ambition.

All wars originate in fear and AMBITION. All the most serious problems in life originate in AMBITION.

Everyone lives in a struggle against everyone else due to ambition, some against others and all against all.

Everyone in life ASPIRES TO BE SOMETHING, and people of a certain age, teachers, parents, guardians, etc. encourage boys, girls, young women, young men, etc. to continue along the horrendous path of AMBITION.

The elders tell the students, you have to be something in life, become rich, marry millionaire people, be powerful, etc. etc.

The old, horrible, ugly, outdated generations want the new generations to also be ambitious, ugly, and horrible like them.

The most serious thing about all this is that new people let themselves be "DAZZLED" and also let themselves be led along that horrible path of AMBITION.

Teachers should teach STUDENTS that no honest work deserves contempt, it is absurd to look with contempt at the taxi driver, the counter clerk, the peasant, the shoe cleaner, etc.

All humble work is beautiful. All humble work is necessary in social life.

Not all of us were born to be engineers, governors, presidents, doctors, lawyers, etc.

In the social conglomerate all jobs are needed, all trades, no honest work can ever be despicable.

In practical life each human being is good for something and the important thing is to know what each one is good for.

It is the duty of TEACHERS to discover the VOCATION of each student and guide them in that direction.

He who works in life according to his VOCATION will work with TRUE LOVE and without AMBITION.

LOVE should replace AMBITION. VOCATION is what we really like, that profession that we perform with joy because it is what we like, what we LOVE.

In modern life, unfortunately, people work reluctantly and out of ambition because they perform jobs that do not coincide with their vocation.

When one works in what one likes, in one's true vocation, one does it with LOVE because one LOVES one's vocation, because one's ATTITUDES for life are precisely those of one's vocation.

That is precisely the job of teachers. Knowing how to guide their students, discover their aptitudes, guide them along the path of their authentic vocation.
