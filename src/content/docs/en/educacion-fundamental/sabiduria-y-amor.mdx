WISDOM and LOVE are the two central pillars of all true civilization.

In one pan of the scales of justice, we must put WISDOM; in the other pan, we must put LOVE.

Wisdom and Love must balance each other. Wisdom without Love is a destructive element. Love without Wisdom can lead us to error "LOVE IS LAW BUT CONSCIOUS LOVE".

It is necessary to study hard and acquire knowledge, but it is also URGENT to develop the SPIRITUAL BEING within us.

Knowledge without a well-developed SPIRITUAL BEING in a harmonious way within us becomes the cause of what is called ROGUERY.

The BEING well developed within us but without intellectual knowledge of any kind gives rise to stupid Saints.

A stupid Saint possesses the SPIRITUAL BEING highly developed, but since he has no intellectual knowledge, he cannot do anything because he does not know how to do it.

THE stupid SAINT has the power to Do but cannot do because he does not know how to do it.

Intellectual knowledge without a well-developed SPIRITUAL BEING produces intellectual confusion, perversity, pride, etc., etc.

During World War II, thousands of scientists devoid of all Spiritual element, in the name of science and humanity, committed appalling crimes for the purpose of doing scientific experiments.

We need to form a powerful intellectual culture but tremendously balanced with true conscious Spirituality.

We need a REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS and a REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY if we truly want to dissolve the I to develop the legitimately Spiritual BEING within us.

It is regrettable that due to a lack of LOVE people use the INTELLECT in a destructive way.

Students need to study science, history, mathematics, etc., etc.

It is necessary to acquire vocational knowledge, with the purpose of being useful to others.

Studying is necessary. Accumulating basic knowledge is essential, but fear is not essential.

Many people accumulate knowledge out of fear; they are Afraid of life, of death, of hunger, of misery, of what others will say, etc., and for that reason they study.

One must study for Love of our fellow human beings with the desire to serve them better, but one must never study out of fear.

In practical life, we have been able to verify that all those students who study out of fear, sooner or later become rogues.

We need to be honest with ourselves to self-observe and discover in ourselves all the processes of fear.

We must never forget in life that fear has many phases. Sometimes fear is confused with courage. Soldiers on the battlefield seem very brave, but in reality, they move and fight because of fear. The suicide also seems at first glance very brave, but in reality, he is a coward who is afraid of life.

Every rogue in life appears to be very brave, but deep down he is a coward. Rogues tend to use their profession and power destructively when they are afraid. Example; Castro RÃºa; in Cuba.

We never pronounce ourselves against the experience of practical life or against the cultivation of the intellect, but we condemn the lack of LOVE.

Knowledge and life experiences are destructive when LOVE is lacking.

THE EGO tends to trap experiences and intellectual knowledge when there is an absence of what is called LOVE.

THE EGO abuses experiences and the intellect when it uses them to strengthen itself.

By disintegrating the EGO, I, MYSELF, experiences and the Intellect remain in the hands of the INTIMATE BEING, and all abuse then becomes impossible.

Every student should be guided by the vocational path and study in depth all the theories related to his vocation.

Study, the intellect, does not harm anyone, but we must not abuse the intellect.

We need to study so as not to abuse the mind. One abuses the mind who wants to study the theories of different vocations, who wants to harm others with the intellect, who exerts violence on another's mind, etc. etc. etc.

It is necessary to study professional subjects and spiritual subjects to have a balanced mind.

It is URGENT to arrive at intellectual SYNTHESIS and Spiritual synthesis if we truly want a balanced mind.

The Teachers of Schools, colleges, Universities, etc., must study our Revolutionary Psychology in depth if they truly want to lead their students along the path of FUNDAMENTAL REVOLUTION.

It is necessary for students to acquire the SPIRITUAL BEING, to develop in themselves the TRUE BEING, so that they leave School transformed into responsible individuals and not into stupid ROGUES.

Wisdom without Love is useless. Intellect without Love only produces Rogues.

Wisdom in itself is Atomic Substance, Atomic capital that should only be administered by individuals full of true Love.
