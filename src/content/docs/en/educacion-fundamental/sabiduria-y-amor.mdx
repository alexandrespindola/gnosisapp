WISDOM and LOVE are the two pivotal columns of all true civilisation.

On one side of the scales of justice, we must place WISDOM, on the other side we must place LOVE.

Wisdom and Love must balance each other. Wisdom without Love is a destructive element. Love without Wisdom can lead us into error "LOVE IS LAW BUT CONSCIOUS LOVE".

It is necessary to study a great deal and acquire knowledge, but it is also URGENT to develop the SPIRITUAL BEING within us.

Knowledge without the SPIRITUAL BEING well developed in a harmonious way within us becomes the cause of what is called ROGUERY.

The BEING well developed within us but without intellectual knowledge of any kind, gives rise to stupid Saints.

A stupid Saint possesses the SPIRITUAL BEING very developed, but as he has no intellectual knowledge, he can do nothing because he does not know how to do it.

THE stupid SAINT has the power to Do but cannot do it because he does not know how to do it.

Intellectual knowledge without the SPIRITUAL BEING well developed produces intellectual confusion, perversity, pride, etc., etc.

During the Second World War, thousands of scientists devoid of any Spiritual element, in the name of science and humanity, committed appalling crimes for the purpose of carrying out scientific experiments.

We need to form a powerful intellectual culture but tremendously balanced with true conscious Spirituality.

We need a REVOLUTIONARY ETHIC and a REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY if we truly want to dissolve the EGO in order to develop the legitimately Spiritual BEING within us.

It is regrettable that due to lack of LOVE people use INTELLECT in a destructive way.

Students need to study science, history, mathematics, etc., etc.

It is necessary to acquire vocational knowledge, with the purpose of being useful to others.

Studying is necessary. Accumulating basic knowledge is indispensable, but fear is not indispensable.

Many people accumulate knowledge out of fear; they are Afraid of life, of death, of hunger, of misery, of what others will say, etc., and for that reason they study.

One should study out of Love for our fellow human beings with the desire to serve them better, but one should never study out of fear.

In practical life, we have been able to verify that all those students who study out of fear, sooner or later become rogues.

We need to be sincere with ourselves in order to self-observe and discover in ourselves all the processes of fear.

We must never forget in life that fear has many phases. Sometimes fear is confused with courage. Soldiers on the battlefield seem very courageous but in reality, they move and fight because of fear. The suicide also seems at first glance very courageous but in reality, he is a coward who is afraid of life.

Every rogue in life appears to be very courageous but deep down he is a coward. Rogues tend to use profession and power in a destructive way when they are afraid. Example; Castro RÃºa; in Cuba.

We never speak out against the experience of practical life or against the cultivation of the intellect, but we condemn the lack of LOVE.

Knowledge and experiences of life are destructive when LOVE is lacking.

THE EGO tends to trap experiences and intellectual knowledge when there is an absence of what is called LOVE.

THE EGO abuses experiences and intellect when it uses them to strengthen itself.

By disintegrating the EGO, I, MYSELF, experiences and Intellect remain in the hands of the INTIMATE BEING and all abuse then becomes impossible.

Every student should be guided along the vocational path and study in depth all the theories that are related to their vocation.

Study, the intellect, does not harm anyone but we must not abuse the intellect.

We need to study in order not to abuse the mind. One who wants to study the theories of different vocations, one who wants to harm others with the intellect, one who exercises violence on the mind of others, etc. etc. etc. abuses the mind.

It is necessary to study professional subjects and spiritual subjects in order to have a balanced mind.

It is URGENT to arrive at the intellectual SYNTHESIS and the Spiritual synthesis if we truly want a balanced mind.

Teachers of Schools, colleges, Universities, etc., should study our Revolutionary Psychology in depth if they truly want to lead their students along the path of the FUNDAMENTAL REVOLUTION.

It is necessary for students to acquire the SPIRITUAL BEING, to develop within themselves the TRUE BEING, so that they leave School as responsible individuals and not as stupid ROGUES.

Wisdom without Love is useless. Intellect without Love only produces Rogues.

Wisdom in itself is Atomic Substance, Atomic capital that should only be administered by individuals full of true Love.
