In our home and at school, parents and teachers always tell us what to think but never in our lives do they teach us HOW TO THINK.

Knowing what to think is relatively easy. Our parents, teachers, tutors, book authors, etc. etc. etc. each one is a dictator in their own way, each one wants us to think in their dictations, demands, theories, prejudices, etc.

Dictators of the mind abound like weeds. There is everywhere a perverse tendency to enslave the minds of others, to bottle it up, to force it to live within certain norms, prejudices, schools, etc.

The thousands and millions of DICTATORS of the mind have never wanted to respect anyone's mental freedom. If someone does not think like them, they are labeled as perverse, renegade, ignorant, etc. etc. etc.

Everyone wants to enslave everyone, everyone wants to trample on the intellectual freedom of others. Nobody wants to respect the freedom of thought of others. Each one feels JUDICIOUS, WISE, WONDERFUL, and naturally wants others to be like him, to make him their model, to think like him.

The mind has been abused too much. Observe the MERCHANTS, and their propaganda through the newspaper, radio, television, etc. etc. etc.

Commercial propaganda is done in a dictatorial way: Buy such-and-such soap! Such and such shoes! So many pesos! So many dollars! Buy right now! Immediately! Don't leave it for tomorrow! It has to be immediately! etc. They only need to say that if you don't obey, we'll put you in jail, or we'll kill you.

The father wants to force his ideas on his son and the school teacher scolds, punishes and gives low grades if the boy or girl does not DICTATORIALLY accept the teacher's ideas.

Half of humanity wants to enslave the minds of the other half of humanity. This tendency to enslave the minds of others is clearly evident when we study the black page of black history.

Everywhere there have been and are BLOODY DICTATORSHIPS determined to enslave the people. Bloody dictatorships that dictate what people should think. Woe to him! who tries to think freely: that one inevitably goes to concentration camps, to Siberia, to jail, to forced labor, to the gallows, to the firing squad, to exile, etc.

Neither TEACHERS, nor PARENTS, nor books, want to teach HOW TO THINK.

People love to force others to think according to how they think it should be and it is clear that everyone in this is a DICTATOR in their own way, everyone believes they have the last word, everyone firmly believes that everyone else should think like him, because he is the best of the best.

Parents, teachers, employers, etc. etc. etc., scold and scold again their subordinates.

It is appalling this horrible tendency of humanity to disrespect others, to trample on the minds of others, to cage, enclose, enslave, chain the thoughts of others.

The husband wants to force his ideas into the woman's head and by force, his doctrine, his ideas, etc. and the woman wants to do the same.

Many times husband and wife divorce due to incompatibility of ideas.

The spouses do not want to understand the need to respect the intellectual freedom of others.

No spouse has the right to enslave the mind of another spouse. Each one is in fact worthy of respect. Each one has the right to think as they want, to profess their religion, to belong to the political party they want.

Children in school are forced to think about such and such ideas, but they are not taught how to manage their minds.

The minds of children are tender, elastic, ductile and the minds of the old are already hard, fixed, like clay in a mold, it no longer changes, it can no longer change.

The minds of children and young people are susceptible to many changes, they can change.

Children and young people can be taught how to THINK. It is very difficult to teach the old HOW TO THINK because they are already as they are and so they die.

It is very rare to find in life an old person interested in changing radically.

People's minds are molded from childhood. That is what parents and school teachers prefer to do. They enjoy shaping the minds of children and young people.

A mind placed in a mold is in fact a conditioned mind, a slave mind.

It is necessary for SCHOOL TEACHERS to break the shackles of the mind.

It is urgent that teachers know how to direct the minds of children towards true freedom so that they are not enslaved anymore.

It is essential that teachers teach students HOW TO THINK.

Teachers must understand the need to teach students the path of analysis, meditation, understanding.

No understanding person should ever accept anything dogmatically. It is urgent to investigate first. Understand, inquire, before accepting.

In other words, we will say that there is no need to accept, but to investigate, analyze, meditate and understand. When understanding is full, acceptance is unnecessary.

It is useless to fill our heads with intellectual information if when leaving school WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO THINK and we continue as LIVING AUTOMATONS, as machines, repeating the same routine of our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents, etc.

Always repeating the same thing, living a life of machines, from home to the office and from the office to home, getting married to become little machines for making children, that is not living and if that is what we study for, and that is why we go to school and college and university for ten or fifteen years, it would be better not to study.

MAHATMA GHANDI was a very unique man. Many times Protestant pastors sat at his door for hours and hours struggling to convert him to Christianity in its Protestant form.

Ghandi did not accept the teachings of the pastors, nor did he reject them, he UNDERSTOOD them, he RESPECTED them, and that is all.

Many times the MAHATMA said: "I am Brahman, Jew, Christian, Mohammedan, etc. etc. etc.

THE MAHATMA understood that all religions are necessary because they all preserve the same ETERNAL VALUES.

Accepting or rejecting a doctrine OR concept reveals a lack of mental maturity.

When we reject or accept something, it is because we have not understood it.

Where there is UNDERSTANDING, acceptance or rejection is unnecessary.

The mind that believes, the mind that does not believe, the mind that doubts, is an IGNORANT mind.

The path of WISDOM does not consist of BELIEVING or not BELIEVING or DOUBTING.

The path of WISDOM consists of INQUIRING, analyzing, meditating and EXPERIMENTING.

TRUTH is the unknown from moment to moment. Truth has nothing to do with what one believes or ceases to believe, nor does skepticism.

TRUTH is not a question of accepting something or rejecting it. TRUTH is a question of EXPERIENCING, LIVING, UNDERSTANDING.

All the efforts of TEACHERS should ultimately lead students to the EXPERIENCE of the real, of the true.

It is URGENT that TEACHERS abandon that antiquated and pernicious tendency always aimed at MODELING the PLASTIC and DUCTILE mind of children.

It is absurd that ADULT people full of prejudices, passions, antiquated preconceptions, etc. trample on the minds of children and young people in this way, trying to model their minds according to their stale, clumsy, antiquated ideas.

It is better to respect the INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM of the STUDENTS, to respect their mental promptness, their creative spontaneity.

Teachers have no right to cage the minds of students.

The fundamental thing is not to DICTATE to the MIND of the students what to think, but to teach them in a complete way, HOW TO THINK.

The MIND is the instrument of KNOWLEDGE and it is necessary for TEACHERS to teach their students to use that instrument wisely.
