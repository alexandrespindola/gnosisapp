In practice, we have been able to verify that both MATERIALISTIC SCHOOLS and SPIRITUALIST SCHOOLS are completely bottled up in the DOGMA of EVOLUTION.

Modern opinions on the origin of man and his past EVOLUTION are, at heart, pure CHEAP SOPHISTRY, and do not withstand deep critical scrutiny.

Despite all the theories of DARWIN accepted as an article of blind FAITH by KARL MARX and his much-vaunted DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM, modern scientists know nothing about the origin of man, nothing is known to them, they have experienced nothing directly, and they lack specific concrete, exact evidence about HUMAN EVOLUTION.

On the contrary, if we take historical humanity, that is, the last twenty or thirty thousand years before Jesus Christ, we find exact evidence, unmistakable signs of a superior type of man, incomprehensible to modern people, and whose presence can be demonstrated by multiple testimonies, old Hieroglyphics, ancient Pyramids, exotic monoliths, mysterious papyri, and various ancient monuments.

As for PREHISTORIC MAN, those strange and mysterious creatures with an appearance so similar to the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL and yet so distinct, so different, so mysterious and whose illustrious bones are sometimes hidden deep in archaic deposits of the Glacial or Pre-glacial period, modern scientists know nothing exactly and from direct experience.

GNOSTIC SCIENCE teaches that the RATIONAL ANIMAL as we know it is not a PERFECT BEING, it is not yet MAN in the complete sense of the word; nature develops it to a certain point and then abandons it, leaving it completely free to continue its development or lose all its possibilities and degenerate.

The LAWS of EVOLUTION and INVOLUTION are the mechanical axis of all nature and have nothing to do with the INTIMATE SELF-REALIZATION of the BEING.

Within the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL there are tremendous possibilities that can be developed or lost, it is not a law that they will develop. Evolutionary mechanics cannot develop them.

The development of such latent possibilities is only possible under well-defined conditions, and this requires tremendous individual SUPER-EFFORTS and efficient help from those MASTERS who have already done that work in the past.

Anyone who wants to develop all their latent possibilities to become a man must enter the path of the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

THE INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL is the GRAIN, the SEED; from that seed can be born the TREE OF LIFE, the TRUE MAN, that MAN who DIOGENES was looking for with a lit lamp through the streets of ATHENS at noon and whom he unfortunately could not find.

It is NOT a LAW that this grain, that this special seed can develop, the normal, the natural thing is that it is lost.

THE TRUE MAN is as different from the INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL as LIGHTNING is from the cloud.

If the grain does not die, the seed does not germinate, it is necessary, it is urgent that the EGO, the I, the MYSELF dies, so that MAN can be born.

The Masters and Mistresses of Schools, Colleges and Universities, must teach their students the PATH of REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS, only in this way is it possible to achieve the death of the EGO.

EMPHASIZING, we can affirm that the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS is not only rare in this world, but is becoming rarer and rarer.

The REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS has three perfectly defined factors: First, Dying; Second, Being Born; Third, Sacrifice for humanity. The order of the factors does not alter the product.

DYING is a matter of REVOLUTIONARY ETHICS and DISSOLUTION of the PSYCHOLOGICAL I.

BEING BORN is a matter of SEXUAL TRANSMUTATION, this matter corresponds to TRANSCENDENTAL SEXOLOGY, whoever wants to study this topic should write to us and get to know our Gnostic books.

SACRIFICE for humanity is CONSCIOUS UNIVERSAL CHARITY.

If we do not desire the REVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS, if we do not make tremendous SUPER-EFFORTS to develop those latent possibilities that will lead us to INTIMATE SELF-REALIZATION, it is clear that these possibilities will never develop.

Those who SELF-REALIZE, those who are saved are very rare, and there is no injustice in this, why should the poor INTELLECTUAL ANIMAL have what it does not want?

A radical, total and definitive change is needed, but not all beings want that change, they do not desire it, they do not know it, and they are told and they do not understand it, they do not comprehend it, they are not interested. Why should they be given by force what they do not want?

The truth is that before the individual acquires NEW FACULTIES or NEW POWERS, which he does not know remotely and which he does not yet possess, he must acquire faculties and powers that he mistakenly believes he has, but which he does not really have.
