The government has AUTHORITY, the STATE has AUTHORITY. The police, the law, the soldier, parents, teachers, religious leaders, etc., have AUTHORITY.

There are two types of AUTHORITY. First, SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY. Second, CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY.

UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES are useless. We URGENTLY need SELF-AWARE AUTHORITIES.

UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES have filled the world with tears and pain.

At home and at school, UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES abuse AUTHORITY by the very fact that they are UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS.

Unconscious parents and teachers, as things stand, are only blind guides to the blind, and as the scriptures say, they will all end up headfirst in the abyss.

Unconscious parents and teachers force us during childhood to do absurd things, but which they consider logical. They say that it is for our own good.

Parents are UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES as demonstrated by the fact that they treat their children like rubbish, as if they were superior beings to the human species.

Teachers end up hating certain pupils and pampering or indulging others. Sometimes they severely punish any hated student even when the latter is not perverse, and reward many spoiled pupils who truly do not deserve it with magnificent grades.

Parents and school teachers dictate incorrect rules for boys, girls, young men, young women, etc.

AUTHORITIES who do not have SELF-AWARENESS can only do absurd things.

We need SELF-AWARE AUTHORITIES. SELF-AWARENESS is understood as the INTEGRAL KNOWLEDGE OF ONESELF, the total knowledge of all our INTERNAL VALUES.

Only he who truly possesses full knowledge of HIMSELF is fully awake. That is to be SELF-AWARE.

Everyone believes that they KNOW THEMSELVES, but it is very difficult to find someone in life who really knows themselves. People have totally wrong concepts about themselves.

Knowing oneself requires great and terrible SELF-EFFORTS. Only through the KNOWLEDGE OF ONESELF does one TRULY reach SELF-AWARENESS.

ABUSE of AUTHORITY is due to UNCONSCIOUSNESS. No SELF-AWARE AUTHORITY would ever reach the ABUSE of AUTHORITY.

Some philosophers are against all AUTHORITY, they detest AUTHORITIES. Such a way of thinking is FALSE because in all that is created, from the microbe to the sun, there are scales and scales, degrees and degrees, superior forces that control and direct and inferior forces that are controlled and directed.

In a simple beehive there is authority in the QUEEN. In any anthill there is authority and laws. The destruction of the principle of AUTHORITY would lead to ANARCHY.

The AUTHORITIES of these critical times in which we live are UNCONSCIOUS and it is clear that due to this PSYCHOLOGICAL fact, they enslave, chain, abuse, and cause pain.

We need TEACHERS, instructors or spiritual guides, government authorities, parents, etc., fully SELF-AWARE. Only then can we truly make a BETTER WORLD.

It is stupid to say that teachers and spiritual guides are not needed.

It is absurd to ignore the principle of AUTHORITY in all that is created.

Those who are SELF-SUFFICIENT, PROUD, believe that TEACHERS and SPIRITUAL GUIDES ARE NOT NECESSARY.

We must recognise our own NATIVITY and MISERY. We must understand that we need AUTHORITIES, TEACHERS, SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTORS, etc. BUT SELF-AWARE so that they can direct, help and guide us wisely.

The UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY of TEACHERS destroys the creative power of pupils. If the pupil paints, the unconscious teacher tells him what he should paint, the tree or landscape that he should copy, and the terrified pupil does not dare to deviate from the teacher's mechanical rules.

That is not creating. It is necessary that the student becomes a creator. That he is capable of breaking away from the unconscious rules of the UNCONSCIOUS TEACHER, so that he can transmit everything that he feels in relation to the tree, all the charm of life that circulates through the trembling leaves of the tree, all its deep significance.

A CONSCIOUS TEACHER would not oppose the liberating creativity of the spirit.

TEACHERS with CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY would never mutilate the minds of the pupils.

UNCONSCIOUS teachers destroy the minds and intelligence of the pupils with their AUTHORITY.

TEACHERS with UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY only know how to punish and dictate stupid rules so that the pupils behave well.

SELF-AWARE TEACHERS teach their pupils with great patience, helping them to understand their individual difficulties, so that by understanding they can transcend all their mistakes and advance triumphantly.

CONSCIOUS or SELF-AWARE AUTHORITY could never destroy INTELLIGENCE.

UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY destroys INTELLIGENCE and causes serious damage to pupils.

Intelligence only comes to us when we enjoy true freedom and TEACHERS WITH SELF-AWARE AUTHORITY truly know how to respect CREATIVE FREEDOM.

UNCONSCIOUS TEACHERS believe that they know everything and trample on the freedom of students, castrating their intelligence with their lifeless rules.

SELF-AWARE TEACHERS KNOW that they do NOT KNOW and even indulge in learning by observing the creative capacities of their disciples.

It is necessary for students in schools, colleges and universities to move from the simple condition of disciplined automatons to the brilliant position of intelligent and free beings so that they can successfully face all the difficulties of existence.

This requires SELF-AWARE, competent TEACHERS who are really interested in their disciples, teachers who are well paid so that they do not have monetary anxieties of any kind.

Unfortunately, every TEACHER, every parent, every pupil, believes himself to be SELF-AWARE. AWAKE and that is their GREATEST ERROR.

It is very rare to find in life a SELF-AWARE and AWAKE person.

People dream when the body sleeps and dream when the body is awake.

People drive cars, dreaming; work dreaming; walk the streets dreaming; live at all hours dreaming.

It is very natural for a teacher to forget their umbrella or leave a book or wallet abandoned in the car. All this happens because the teacher's consciousness is asleep, dreaming...

It is very difficult for people to accept that they are asleep, everyone believes themselves to be awake. If someone accepted that their consciousness was asleep, it is clear that from that very moment they would begin to awaken.

The pupil forgets at home the book, or the notebook that they have to take to school, such forgetfulness seems very normal and it is, but it indicates, points to, the state of sleep in which human consciousness is found.

Passengers on any urban transport service often miss their stop, they were asleep and when they wake up they realise that they have missed their stop and that now they will have to walk back a few streets.

Rarely in life is the human being really awake and when they have been even for a moment, as in cases of infinite terror, they see themselves for a moment in an INTEGRAL way. Those moments are unforgettable.

The man who returns to his house after having travelled all over the city, it is very difficult for him to remember in a meticulous way all his thoughts, incidents, people, things, ideas, etc. etc. etc. when trying to remember, he will find in his memory great gaps that correspond precisely to the states of deepest sleep.

Some psychology students have set out to live ALERT from moment to moment, but suddenly they fall asleep, perhaps when meeting a friend in the street, when entering a store to buy something, etc. and when hours later they remember their decision to live ALERT and AWAKE from moment to moment, then they realise that they had fallen asleep when they entered such and such a place, or when they met such and such a person, etc. etc. etc.

Being SELF-AWARE is something very difficult but you can reach this state by learning to live alert and vigilant from MOMENT to MOMENT.

If we want to reach SELF-AWARENESS we need to know ourselves in an INTEGRAL way.

All of us have the I, the MYSELF, the EGO that we need to explore to know ourselves and become SELF-AWARE.

It is URGENT to SELF OBSERVE, ANALYSE and UNDERSTAND each of our defects.

It is necessary to study ourselves in the field of mind, emotions, habits, instincts and sex.

The mind has many LEVELS, regions or SUBCONSCIOUS departments that we must know in depth through OBSERVATION, ANALYSIS, DEEP MEDITATION and DEEP INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING.

Any defect can disappear from the intellectual region and continue to exist in other unconscious levels of the mind.

The first thing that is needed is to AWAKEN to understand our own MISERY, NATIVITY and PAIN. Then the I begins to DIE from moment to moment. THE DEATH OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL I is URGENT.

Only by dying is the truly CONSCIOUS BEING born in us. Only the BEING can exercise true CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY.

AWAKEN, DIE, BE BORN. These are the three psychological phases that lead us to TRUE CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE.

One must awaken to DIE and one must die to BE BORN. He who dies without having AWAKENED becomes a STUPID SAINT. He who IS BORN without having died becomes an INDIVIDUAL with a DOUBLE PERSONALITY, the very JUST and the very perverse.

The exercise of true AUTHORITY can only be exercised by those who possess the conscious BEING.

Those who do not yet possess the CONSCIOUS BEING, those who are not yet SELF-AWARE, tend to ABUSE AUTHORITY and cause much damage.

TEACHERS must learn to command and pupils must learn to obey.

Those PSYCHOLOGISTS who speak out against obedience are in fact very wrong because no one can command consciously if they have not first learned to obey.

One must know how to command CONSCIOUSLY and one must know how to obey consciously.
