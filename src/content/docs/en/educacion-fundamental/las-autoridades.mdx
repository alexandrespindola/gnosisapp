    label: 3. The Authorities
    order: 3

The government possesses AUTHORITY, the STATE possesses AUTHORITY. The police, the law, the soldier, the parents, the teachers, the religious leaders, etc., possess AUTHORITY.

There are two types of AUTHORITY. First, SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY. Second, CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY.

UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES are useless. We URGENTLY need SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES.

UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES have filled the world with tears and pain.

In the home and at school, UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES abuse AUTHORITY by the very fact of being UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS.

Unconscious parents and teachers, today, are only blind guides of the blind and, as the sacred scriptures say, they will all end up headfirst in the abyss.

Unconscious parents and teachers force us during childhood to do absurd things, but which they consider logical. They say that is for our own good.

Parents are UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES as demonstrated by the fact of treating their children like garbage, as if they were superior beings to the human species.

Teachers end up hating certain students, and pampering or indulging others. Sometimes they severely punish any hated student even when the latter is not perverse and reward with magnificent grades many spoiled students who truly do not deserve them.

Parents and school teachers dictate wrong rules for boys, girls, young people, young women, etc.

AUTHORITIES who do not have SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS can only do absurd things.

We need SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS is understood as the INTEGRAL KNOWLEDGE OF ONESELF, the total knowledge of all our INTERNAL VALUES.

Only he who truly possesses full knowledge of HIMSELF is fully awake. That is to be SELF-CONSCIOUS.

Everyone believes that they KNOW themselves, but it is very difficult to find in life someone who really knows himself. People have completely wrong concepts about themselves.

Knowing oneself requires great and terrible SELF-EFFORTS. Only through KNOWLEDGE OF ONESELF can one TRULY reach SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.

The ABUSE of AUTHORITY is due to UNCONSCIOUSNESS. No SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY would ever reach the ABUSE of AUTHORITY.

Some philosophers are against all AUTHORITY, they detest AUTHORITIES. Such a way of thinking is FALSE because in all that is created, from the microbe to the sun, there are scales and scales, degrees and degrees, superior forces that control and direct and inferior forces that are controlled and directed.

In a simple beehive there is authority in the QUEEN. In any anthill there is authority and laws. The destruction of the principle of AUTHORITY would lead to ANARCHY.

The AUTHORITIES of these critical times in which we live are UNCONSCIOUS and it is clear that due to this PSYCHOLOGICAL fact, they enslave, chain, abuse, cause pain.

We need TEACHERS, instructors or spiritual guides, government authorities, parents, etc., fully SELF-CONSCIOUS. Only then can we truly make a BETTER WORLD.

It is stupid to say that teachers and spiritual guides are not needed.

It is absurd to ignore the principle of AUTHORITY in all that is created.

Those who are SELF-SUFFICIENT, PROUD, think that TEACHERS and SPIRITUAL GUIDES ARE NOT NECESSARY.

We must recognize our own POVERTY and MISERY. We must understand that we need AUTHORITIES, TEACHERS, SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTORS, etc. BUT SELF-CONSCIOUS so that they can direct, help and guide us wisely.

The UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY of TEACHERS destroys the creative power of students. If the student paints, the unconscious teacher tells him what to paint, the tree or landscape to copy and the terrified student does not dare to break away from the mechanical norms of the teacher.

That is not creating. It is necessary that the student becomes a creator. That he is capable of breaking away from the unconscious norms of the UNCONSCIOUS TEACHER, so that he can transmit all that he feels in relation to the tree, all the charm of life that circulates through the trembling leaves of the tree, all its deep significance.

A CONSCIOUS TEACHER would not oppose the liberating creativity of the spirit.

TEACHERS with CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY would never mutilate the minds of students.

UNCONSCIOUS teachers destroy with their AUTHORITY the mind and intelligence of the students.

TEACHERS with UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY only know how to punish and dictate stupid rules so that students behave well.

SELF-CONSCIOUS TEACHERS teach their students with great patience, helping them understand their individual difficulties, so that by understanding they can transcend all their mistakes and advance triumphantly.

CONSCIOUS or SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY could never destroy INTELLIGENCE.

UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY destroys INTELLIGENCE and causes serious damage to students.

Intelligence only comes to us when we enjoy true freedom and TEACHERS WITH SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY truly know how to respect CREATIVE FREEDOM.

UNCONSCIOUS TEACHERS believe that they know everything and trample on the freedom of students, castrating their intelligence with their lifeless norms.

SELF-CONSCIOUS teachers KNOW that they do not KNOW and even indulge in learning by observing the creative abilities of their disciples.

It is necessary for students in schools, colleges, and universities to move from the simple condition of disciplined automatons to the brilliant position of intelligent and free beings so that they can successfully face all the difficulties of existence.

This requires SELF-CONSCIOUS, competent TEACHERS who are really interested in their disciples, teachers who are well paid so that they do not have monetary anxieties of any kind.

Unfortunately, every TEACHER, every parent, every student, believes himself to be SELF-CONSCIOUS, AWAKE and that is his GREATEST ERROR.

It is very rare to find in life any SELF-CONSCIOUS and AWAKE person.

People dream when the body sleeps and dream when the body is awake.

People drive cars, dreaming; work dreaming; walk the streets dreaming, live at all hours dreaming.

It is very natural for a professor to forget his umbrella or to leave a book or his wallet abandoned in the car. All this happens because the professor has a sleeping consciousness, dreams...

It is very difficult for people to accept that they are asleep, everyone believes himself to be awake. If someone accepted that his consciousness is asleep, it is clear that from that very moment he would begin to awaken.

The student forgets at home the book, or the notebook that he has to take to school, a forgetfulness of these seems very normal and it is, but it indicates, points out, the state of sleep in which the human consciousness is found.

Passengers of any urban transport service often miss their street, they were asleep and when they wake up they realize that they missed their street and that now they will have to return on foot a few blocks.

Rarely in life is the human being really awake and when he has been so even for a moment, as in cases of infinite terror, he sees himself for a moment in an INTEGRAL way. Those moments are unforgettable.

The man who returns home after having toured the entire city, it is very difficult for him to remember in a detailed way all his thoughts, incidents, people, things, ideas, etc. etc. etc. when trying to remember, he will find in his memory great gaps that correspond precisely to the states of deepest sleep.

Some psychology students have set out to live ALERT from moment to moment, but suddenly they fall asleep, perhaps when finding a friend on the street, when entering a store to buy something, etc. and when hours later they remember their decision to live ALERT and AWAKE from moment to moment, then they realize that they had fallen asleep when they entered such and such place, or when they met such and such person, etc. etc. etc.

Being SELF-CONSCIOUS is something very difficult but one can reach this state by learning to live alert and vigilant from MOMENT to MOMENT.

If we want to reach SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS we need to know ourselves in an INTEGRAL way.

All of us have the I, the MYSELF, the EGO that we need to explore to know ourselves and become SELF-CONSCIOUS.

It is URGENT to SELF-OBSERVE ourselves, ANALYZE and UNDERSTAND each of our defects.

It is necessary to study ourselves in the realm of the mind, emotions, habits, instincts, and sex.

The mind has many LEVELS, regions or SUBCONSCIOUS departments that we must know in depth through OBSERVATION, ANALYSIS, DEEP MEDITATION and DEEP INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING.

Any defect can disappear from the intellectual region and continue to exist in other unconscious levels of the mind.

The first thing needed is to AWAKEN to understand our own MISERY, POVERTY and PAIN. Then the I begins to DIE from moment to moment. The DEATH OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL I is URGENT.

Only by dying is the truly CONSCIOUS BEING born in us. Only HE can exercise true CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY.

AWAKEN, DIE, BE BORN. These are the three psychological phases that lead us to TRUE CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE.

One must awaken to DIE and one must die to BE BORN. He who dies without having AWAKENED becomes a STUPID SAINT. He who is BORN without having died becomes an INDIVIDUAL of DOUBLE PERSONALITY, the very JUST and the very perverse.

The exercise of true AUTHORITY can only be exercised by those who possess the conscious BEING.

Those who do not yet possess the CONSCIOUS BEING, those who are not yet SELF-CONSCIOUS, often ABUSE AUTHORITY and cause much damage.

TEACHERS must learn to command and students must learn to obey.

Those PSYCHOLOGISTS who speak out against obedience are in fact very wrong because no one can command consciously if they have not first learned to obey.

One must know how to command CONSCIOUSLY and one must know how to obey consciously.
