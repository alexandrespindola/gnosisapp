The government possesses AUTHORITY, the STATE possesses AUTHORITY. The police, the law, the soldier, parents, teachers, religious leaders, etc., possess AUTHORITY.

There are two types of AUTHORITY. First, SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY. Second, CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY.

UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY is of no use. We URGENTLY need SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES.

UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES have filled the world with tears and pain.

At home and at school UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES abuse AUTHORITY by the very fact of being UNCONSCIOUS or SUBCONSCIOUS.

Unconscious parents and teachers, today, are only blind guides of the blind and as the holy scriptures say, they will all go headlong into the abyss.

Unconscious parents and teachers force us during our childhood to do absurd things, but which they consider logical. They say it is for our own good.

Parents are UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES as evidenced by the fact that they treat their children like dirt, as if they were superior to the human species.

Teachers turn out to hate certain pupils, and pamper or indulge others. They sometimes severely punish any hated student even when the latter is not a pervert, and reward many pampered students with superb grades who truly do not deserve them.

Parents and school teachers dictate wrong rules for boys, girls, young men, young women, etc.

AUTHORITIES without SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS can only do absurd things.

We need SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITIES. By SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS is understood the INTEGRAL KNOWLEDGE OF SELF, the total knowledge of all our INTERNAL VALUES.

Only he who truly possesses full knowledge of HIMSELF is awake in an integral way. That is to be SELF-CONSCIOUS.

Everyone believes that he KNOWS HIMSELF, but it is very difficult to find someone in life who really knows himself. People have totally wrong concepts about themselves.

To know oneself requires great and terrible SELF-EFFORTS. It is only through SELF-KNOWLEDGE that ONE TRULY COMES TO SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS.

ABUSE of AUTHORITY is due to UNCONSCIOUSNESS. No SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY would ever come to ABUSE of AUTHORITY.

Some philosophers are against all AUTHORITY, they detest AUTHORITIES. Such a way of thinking is FALSE because in everything created, from the microbe to the sun, there are scales and scales and degrees and degrees, higher forces controlling and directing and lower forces being controlled and directed.

In a simple honeycomb there is authority in the QUEEN. In any anthill there is authority and laws. The destruction of the principle of AUTHORITY would lead to ANARCHY.

THE AUTHORITIES of these critical times in which we live are UNCONSCIOUS and it is clear that because of this PSYCHOLOGICAL fact, they enslave, chain, abuse, cause pain.

We need TEACHERS, instructors or spiritual guides, government authorities, parents, etc., fully SELF-CONSCIOUS. Only then can we truly make a BETTER WORLD.

It is stupid to say that spiritual teachers and guides are not needed.

It is absurd to disregard the principle of AUTHORITY in all creation.

Those who are SELF-SUFFICIENT, PROUD, are of the opinion that MASTERS and SPIRIT GUIDES are NOT NECESSARY.

We must recognise our own CHRISTMAS and MISERY. We must realise that we need AUTHORITIES, TEACHERS, SPIRITUAL INSTRUCTORS, etc. BUT SELF-CONSCIOUS so that they can direct, help and guide us wisely.

The UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY of the TEACHERS destroys the creative power of the pupils. If the pupil paints, the unconscious teacher tells him what to paint, what tree or landscape to copy, and the terrified pupil does not dare to deviate from the mechanical rules of the teacher.

That is not creating. It is necessary for the student to become a creator. He must be able to break out of the unconscious rules of the UNCONSCIOUS TEACHER, so that he can transmit all that he feels in relation to the tree, all the charm of life that circulates through the trembling leaves of the tree, all its deep significance.

A CONSCIOUS MASTER would not oppose the liberating creativity of the spirit.

TEACHERS with CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY would never mutilate the minds of pupils.

UNCONSCIOUS teachers destroy with their AUTHORITY the minds and intelligence of the pupils.

TEACHERS with UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY only know how to punish and dictate stupid rules to make the pupils behave.

SELF-CONSCIOUS TEACHERS teach their pupils with great patience, helping them to understand their individual difficulties, so that by understanding they can transcend all their mistakes and advance triumphantly.

CONSCIOUS or SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY could never destroy INTELLIGENCE.

UNCONSCIOUS AUTHORITY destroys INTELLIGENCE and causes serious damage to pupils.

Intelligence only comes to us when we enjoy true freedom and TEACHERS WITH SELF-CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY truly know how to respect CREATIVE FREEDOM.

UNCONSCIOUS TEACHERS think they know everything and trample on the students' freedom by castrating their intelligence with their lifeless rules.

SELF-CONSCIOUS TEACHERS KNOW that they do not KNOW and even have the luxury of learning by observing the creative capacities of their disciples.

It is necessary that the students in schools, colleges and universities be raised from the simple condition of disciplined automatons to the brilliant position of intelligent and free beings so that they can successfully cope with all the difficulties of existence.

This requires SELF-CONSCIOUS, competent TEACHERS who really care for their disciples, teachers who are well paid so that they have no monetary distress of any kind.

Unfortunately, every TEACHER, every parent, every pupil, believes himself to be SELF-CONSCIOUS. AWAKE and that is their BIGGEST MISTAKE.

It is very rare to find in life a SELF-CONSCIOUS and AWAKE person.

People dream when the body sleeps and dream when the body is in the waking state.

People drive cars, dreaming; they work dreaming; they walk the streets dreaming; they live all the time dreaming.

It is quite natural for a teacher to forget his umbrella or to leave a book or his wallet in the car. All this happens because the teacher's conscience is asleep, he dreams...

It is very difficult for people to accept that they are asleep, everyone thinks they are awake. If someone accepts that his or her consciousness is asleep, it is clear that from that very moment he or she would begin to wake up.

The pupil forgets the book or the notebook at home that he or she has to take to school; such forgetfulness seems quite normal, and it is, but it indicates, it signals, the state of sleep in which the human consciousness finds itself.

Passengers on any urban transport service sometimes overshoot the road, they were asleep and when they wake up they realise that they have overshot the road and that now they will have to walk back a few streets.

Rarely in life is the human being really awake and when he has been awake for even a moment, as in cases of infinite terror, he sees himself for a moment in INTEGRAL form. Such moments are unforgettable.

The man who returns home after having travelled all over the city, it is very difficult for him to recall in minute detail all his thoughts, incidents, people, things, ideas, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. In trying to remember, he will find in his memory great gaps which correspond precisely to the deepest dream states.

Some students of psychology have set out to live ALERT from moment to moment, but suddenly fall asleep, perhaps when they meet a friend in the street, when they enter a store to buy something, etc., and when hours later they remember their decision to live ALERT and AWAKE from moment to moment, then they come to realise that they had fallen asleep when they entered such and such a place, or when they met such and such a person, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

To be SELF-CONSCIOUS is something very difficult but it is possible to reach this state by learning to live alert and vigilant from MOMENT to MOMENT.

If we want to reach SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS we need to know ourselves INTEGRALLY.

We all have the I, the SELF, the EGO that we need to explore in order to know ourselves and become SELF AWARE.

It is URGENT to SELF OBSERVE, ANALYSE and UNDERSTAND each one of our defects.

It is necessary to study ourselves in the realm of mind, emotions, habits, instincts and sex.

The mind has many LEVELS, regions or SUBCONSCIOUS departments which we must know in depth through OBSERVATION, ANALYSIS, DEEP MEDITATION and DEEP INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING.

Any defect can disappear from the intellectual region and continue to exist in other unconscious levels of the mind.

The first thing that is needed is AWAKENING to understand our own MISERY, NURSING and PAIN. Then the SELF begins to DIE from moment to moment. The DEATH OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EGO IS URGENT.

Only by dying is the truly CONSCIOUS BEING born in us. Only the BEING can exercise true CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY.

AWAKENING, DYING, BEING BORN. These are the three psychological phases that lead us to TRUE CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE.

One must awaken in order to DIE and one must die in order to BE BORN. Whoever dies without having AWAKENED becomes a STUPID SAINT. Whoever is BORN without having died becomes an INDIVIDUAL of DOUBLE PERSONALITY, the very RIGHTEOUS and the very perverse.

The exercise of true AUTHORITY can only be exercised by those who possess the conscious BEING.

Those who do not yet possess the CONSCIOUS SELF, those who are not yet SELF-CONSCIOUS, often ABUSE AUTHORITY and cause much harm.

TEACHERS must learn to command and pupils must learn to obey.

Those PSYCHOLOGISTS who speak out against obedience are in fact very wrong, for no one can consciously command unless he has first learned to obey.

One must know how to command CONSCIOUSLY and one must know how to obey consciously.
