Human life begins as a simple cell subject, as is natural, to the extraordinarily rapid pace of living cells.

Conception, gestation, birth, it is always the marvellous and formidable trio with which the life of any creature begins.

It is truly surprising to know that our first moments of existence must be lived in the infinitely small, each of us converted into a simple microscopic cell.

We begin to exist in the form of an insignificant cell and end life old, elderly and burdened with memories.

The I is memory. Many elderly people do not remotely live in the present, many old people live only remembering the past. Every old man is nothing more than a voice and a shadow. Every old man is a ghost of the past, accumulated memory and this is what continues in the genes of our descendants.

Human conception begins with extraordinarily fast times, but through the different processes of life they become slower and slower.

Many readers should remember the relativity of time. The insignificant insect that only lives a few hours on a summer afternoon, seems as if it hardly lives at all, but it really lives as much as a man lives in eighty years, what happens is that it lives quickly, a man lives in eighty years all that a planet lives in millions of years.

When the sperm joins the egg, gestation begins. The cell with which human life begins, contains forty-eight chromosomes.

Chromosomes are divided into genes, a hundred or so of the latter certainly constitute what is a Chromosome.

Genes are very difficult to study because they are each made up of a few molecules that vibrate with inconceivable speed.

The wonderful world of genes constitutes an intermediate zone between the three-dimensional world and the world of the fourth dimension.

In the genes are the atoms of heredity. The PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF of our ancestors, comes to impregnate the fertilised egg.

In this era of Electro-technology and atomic science, it is by no means an exaggeration to affirm that the electro-magnetic footprint left by an ancestor who exhaled his last breath has come to be imprinted in the genes and chromosomes of the egg fertilised by a descendant.

The path of life is formed with the footprints of the hooves of the horse of death.

During the course of existence, different types of energy flow through the human organism; each type of energy has its own system of action, each type of energy manifests itself in its time and at its hour.

At two months of conception we have the digestive function and at four months of conception the driving force comes into action so intimately related to the respiratory and muscular systems.

The scientific spectacle of the birth and death of all things is wonderful.

Many wise men affirm that there is intimate analogy between the birth of the human creature and the birth of the worlds in sidereal space.

At nine months the child is born, at ten begins the growth with all its wonderful metabolisms and the symmetrical and perfect development of the connective tissues.

When the anterior fontanelle of newborns closes at two or three years of age, it is a sign that the cerebro-spinal system has been perfectly completed.

Many scientists have said that nature has imagination and that this imagination gives living form to all that is, to all that has been to all that will be.

Multitudes of people laugh at the imagination and some even call it the "MAD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE".

Around the word IMAGINATION there is much confusion and there are many who confuse IMAGINATION with FANTASY.

Certain wise men say that there are two imaginations. The first they call MECHANICAL IMAGINATION and the second INTENTIONAL IMAGINATION: The first is constituted by the waste of the mind and the second corresponds to the most worthy and decent thing we have inside.

Through observation and experience we have been able to verify that there is also a type of SUB-IMAGINATION MECHANICAL MORBID INFRACONSCIOUS and SUBJECTIVE.

That type of AUTOMATIC SUB-IMAGINATION works below the INTELLECTUAL ZONE.

Erotic images, morbid films, spicy stories with double meaning, morbid jokes, etc., usually put the MECHANICAL SUB-IMAGINATION to work unconsciously.

In-depth analysis has led us to the logical conclusion that erotic dreams and nocturnal pollutions are due to MECHANICAL SUB-IMAGINATION.

ABSOLUTE CHASTITY is impossible as long as MECHANICAL SUB-IMAGINATION exists.

It is perfectly clear that CONSCIOUS IMAGINATION is radically different from what is called MECHANICAL, SUBJECTIVE, INFRACONSCIOUS. SUBCONSCIOUS IMAGINATION.

Any representation can be perceived in a SELF-ENHANCING and dignifying way, but the SUB-IMAGINATION of mechanical, infraconscious, subconscious, unconscious type can betray us by functioning automatically with nuances and images that are sensual, passionate, submerged.

If we want INTEGRAL, uni-total, in-depth CHASTITY, we need to monitor not only CONSCIOUS IMAGINATION, but also MECHANICAL IMAGINATION and UNCONSCIOUS, AUTOMATIC, SUBCONSCIOUS, SUBMERGED SUB-IMAGINATION.

We must never forget the intimate relationship between SEX and IMAGINATION.

Through deep meditation we must transform all types of mechanical imagination and all forms of AUTOMATIC SUB-IMAGINATION and INFRA-IMAGINATION, into CONSCIOUS, objective IMAGINATION.

OBJECTIVE IMAGINATION is in itself essentially creative, without it the inventor could not have conceived the telephone, the radio, the plane, etc.

The IMAGINATION of the WOMAN in a state of pregnancy is fundamental for the development of the foetus. It is proven that every mother can with her IMAGINATION alter the psyche of the foetus.

It is urgent that the woman in a state of pregnancy contemplate beautiful paintings, sublime landscapes, and listen to classical music and harmonious words, so she can operate on the psyche of the creature she carries in her womb harmoniously.

The woman in a state of pregnancy should not drink alcohol, or smoke, or contemplate what is ugly, what is unpleasant because all this is detrimental to the harmonious development of the creature.

You have to know how to excuse all the whims and mistakes of the pregnant woman.

Many intolerant men lacking true understanding, get angry and insult the woman in a state of pregnancy. The bitterness of this, the afflictions caused by the husband lacking quality, rebound on the foetus in a state of gestation, not only physically but psychically.

Taking into account the power of creative imagination, it is logical to affirm that the woman in a state of pregnancy, should not contemplate what is ugly, what is unpleasant, what is inharmonious, what is disgusting, etc.

The time has come when governments should worry about solving the great problems related to motherhood.

It is incongruous that in a society that prides itself on being Christian and democratic, the religious sense of motherhood is not respected and venerated. It is monstrous to see thousands of women in a state of pregnancy without any protection, abandoned by their husbands and society, begging for a piece of bread or a job and often carrying out harsh material work, in order to survive with the creature they carry in their womb.

These subhuman states of current society, this cruelty and lack of responsibility of rulers and peoples are clearly indicating to us that democracy does not yet exist.

Hospitals with their maternity wards have not yet solved the problem, because these hospitals can only be reached by women when childbirth is approaching.

There is an urgent need for collective homes, true garden cities equipped with lounges and residences for women in a state of pregnancy who are dirt poor, clinics and kindergartens for their children.

These collective homes are accommodation for dirt poor women in a state of pregnancy, full of all kinds of comforts, flowers, music, harmony, beauty, etc., would completely solve the great problem of motherhood.

We must understand that human society is a large family and that there is no problem that is foreign because every problem in one form or another affects within its respective circle all members of society. It is absurd to discriminate against pregnant women because they are dirt poor. It is criminal to underestimate them, despise them or corner them in an asylum for indigents.

In this society in which we live there cannot be children and stepchildren, because we are all human and we have the same rights.

We need to create true democracy, if we really don't want to be devoured by Communism.
