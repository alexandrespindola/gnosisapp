‘Fundamental Education’ is the science that enables us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things. Through this science we know how the mind works because the mind is the instrument of knowledge and we must learn to handle this instrument, which is the basic nucleus of the psychological self.

In this work we are taught in an almost objective way the way of Thinking, by means of investigation, analysis, understanding and meditation.

It informs us how to improve memory recall by always using three factors: subject, object and place; memory is driven by interest, so that one must be interested in what one is studying in order to engrave it in one's memory. The memory improves through the process of alchemical transmutation, which will gradually become known to students who are interested in self-improvement.

For the Westerners, study begins at the age of six, that is, when they are reckoned to have the use of reason; for the Orientals, especially the Indians, education begins at gestation; for the Gnostics, from the time of love affairs, that is, before conception.

Future education will comprise two phases: one by parents and the other by teachers. Future education will place the learners in the Divine knowledge of learning to be fathers and mothers. The woman requires protection, shelter, and therefore the girl is more attached to the father when she is a child because she sees him as stronger and more vigorous; the boy requires love, care, cuddling, and therefore the boy is more attached to the mother by natural instinct. Later, when the senses of both are perverted, the woman looks for a good match or also for a man who loves her, when she is the one who should give love, and the man looks for a woman who has the means to live or who has a profession; for others, the face and bodily forms predominate for their senses.

It is surprising to see the school textbooks, each work with thousands of questions, which the author answers in writing so that the students learn them by heart, the unfaithful memory is the repository of the knowledge that the young people study so hard, this entirely materialistic education enables them to earn a living when they finish their studies, but they know nothing about the life in which they are going to live, they enter it blind, they were not even taught to reproduce the species in an exalted way, this teaching is in charge of the scoundrels in the shadow of impudence.

The young man is required to understand that the seed produced by the human organism, which is the most important factor in the life of man (species), is blessed and therefore the misuse of it will harm his own progeny. On the altars of the Catholic Church the host is kept in the tabernacle with great veneration as representing the body of Christ, that sacred figure; it is formed by the seed of the wheat. In the living altar, that is, our physical body, our seed takes the place of the sacred host of Christianity which follows the historical Christ; in our own seed we keep the Christ in substance, we who follow the living Christ who lives and throbs in the very depths of our own seed.

With great interest we see that the agronomists who are in charge of the knowledge of the plants that serve man, teach the farmers to respect the seed that they water in the fields, we see that they have improved the quality of the seeds to produce better harvests, keeping in large silos the stocks of cereals, so that the seeds that they produced with so much effort will not be lost. We see how the veterinary surgeons, who are in charge of the management of the animals' lives, have succeeded in producing breeding stock or stallions whose cost is a hundred times greater than the product of the meat, which indicates that it is the seed they produce that is the reason for such a high cost. Only official medicine, in whose care the human species is cared for, tells us nothing about the improvement of the seed; we positively regret this delay, and inform our readers that the human seed is the easiest to improve by the permanent use of three basic foods: by what we think, what we breathe, and what we eat. If we think only of vague, insipid, unimportant things, so will be the seed we produce, because thought is the determining factor in such production. The young man who studies differs from the one who does not receive education in appearance and presence, there is a change in personality; the fact of breathing digested beers in bars and canteens, determines the life of the parishioners who frequent those places: People who feed on cakes, pork, beer, spices, alcohol and aphrodisiac food, live a passionate life that leads them to fornication.

Every fornicating animal is foul-smelling: donkeys, pigs, goats and even poultry, even though they are birds, as is the home-grown cockerel. It is easy to appreciate the difference that exists between fornicators and those that man forcibly makes chaste in order to exploit them, look at the gonads of the race horse and those of the pack horses, between the fighting bulls and the stallions that daily appear in the press, the stallion pig, even in small animals such as the rat that is tremendously passionate and always repugnant in appearance, the same thing happens in the fornicating male that covers his stench with deodorants and perfumes. When a man becomes chaste, pure and holy, in thought, word and deed, he regains his lost childhood, he is beautified in body and soul and his body does not perspire with stench.

How is pre-natal education achieved? This happens between couples who follow chastity, that is to say, who never lose their seed in wantonness and ephemeral pleasure, like this: The spouses want to give body to a new being, they agree and ask Heaven to guide them to the event of fertilisation, then in a permanent attitude of love they live together joyfully and festively, they take advantage of the time when nature is most bountiful, They use the process of alchemical transmutation by joining together as husband and wife, which allows the escape of a strong and vigorous spermatozoon, enhanced by the practices known before, and by this means the event of divine conception is achieved, Once the woman perceives that she is pregnant, she separates from the man, that is to say, conjugal life ends, this should be easily done by the chaste man because he is filled with superhuman grace and power, by all means he makes life pleasant for his wife so that she does not resort to molestation or similar things because all this has repercussions on the foetus that is being gestated, if this causes harm, what will not be the fasting that is practised in a libidinous way by people who have never received advice in this sense? This gives reason for many children to feel terrible passions from an early age and to make their mothers blush in a scandalous way.

The mother knows that she is giving life to a new being which she keeps in her Living Temple, like a precious jewel, giving it with her prayers and thoughts beautiful forms which will ennoble the new creature, then comes the event of birth without pain; in a simple and natural way for the glory of its parents. The couple keeps a diet that generally lasts forty days until the womb that served as a cradle for the new being returns to its place, the man knows that the woman who raises the child must be pampered and contemplated, The man knows that the woman who brings up the child must be pampered and contemplated with healthy caresses, for any form of violent passion has repercussions on the mother's breasts and brings obstructions in the channels through which flows the precious liquid that will give life to the child of her womb. The woman who wants to put this teaching into practice will observe that the shame of having to operate on her breasts because of permanent obstructions disappears. Where there is chastity there is love and obedience, children arise naturally and all evil disappears, thus begins this fundamental education for the preparation of the personality of the new being who will go to school ready to follow the education that will allow him to live together and later to earn his daily bread on his own.

In the first 7 years the child forms its own personality in a way that is as important as the months of gestation, and what is expected of a being brought in such conditions is something that humans do not even suspect. Intelligence is an attribute of the Self, we have to know the Self.

Self cannot know Truth because Truth does not belong to time and Self does.

Fear and dread damage free initiative. Initiative is creative, fear is destructive.

By analysing all and meditating, we awaken the dormant consciousness.

Truth is the unknown from instant to instant, it has nothing to do with what one believes or does not believe; truth is a matter of experiencing, living, understanding.
