"Fundamental Education" is the science that allows us to discover our relationship with human beings, with nature, with all things. Through this science, we understand how the mind works because the mind is the instrument of knowledge, and we must learn to manage that instrument, which is the basic core of the psychological self.

In this work, we are taught in an almost objective way how to think, through investigation, analysis, comprehension, and meditation.

It informs us how to improve memory recall, always using three factors: subject, object, and place; memory is moved by interest, so we must take an interest in what we study so that it is etched in our memory. Memory improves through the process of alchemical transmutation, which students interested in personal improvement will gradually learn about.

For Westerners, education begins at age 6, when it is estimated they have the use of reason; for Easterners, especially Hindus, education begins from gestation; for Gnostics, from courtship, that is, before conception.

Future education will encompass two phases: one by the parents and the other by the teachers. Future education will place students in the Divine knowledge of learning to be fathers and mothers. What a woman requires is protection, shelter, which is why a girl is more attached to her father when she is a child because she sees him as stronger and more vigorous; the boy requires love, care, cuddles, which is why the boy is more attached to the mother by natural instinct. Later, when the senses of both are perverted, the woman seeks a good match or a man who loves her, when she is the one who should give love, and the man seeks a woman who has the means to live or has a profession; for others, the face and body shapes predominate for their senses.

It is surprising to see school textbooks, each work with thousands of questions, which the author answers in writing for the students to learn by heart. Unfaithful memory is the repository of knowledge that young people study so diligently. This entirely materialistic education enables them to earn a living when they finish their studies, but they know nothing about the life in which they are going to live. They enter it blindly; they are not even taught to reproduce the species in an exalted way; that teaching is in the hands of thugs in the shadow of impudence.

It is required that the young person understand that the seed that produces the human organism is the most important factor for the life of man (species), it is blessed and therefore the misuse of it will damage his own offspring. In the altars of the Catholic Church, the host is kept in the Tabernacle with the utmost veneration as representative of the body of Christ, that Sacred figure; it is formed by the seed of wheat. In the living altar, that is, our physical body, our seed occupies the place of the sacred host of Christianity that follows the Historical Christ; in our own seed we keep the Christ in substance, those of us who follow the living Christ who lives and throbs in the very depths of our own seed.

With great interest, we see that the agronomists who are in charge of the knowledge of the plants that serve man, teach the peasants to respect the seed they water in the fields, we see that they have improved the quality of the seeds to produce better harvests, keeping large silos with stocks of cereals, so that the seeds that they produced with so much effort are not lost. We see how veterinarians, who are in charge of managing the lives of animals, have managed to produce breeders or stallions whose cost is a hundred times greater than the product of the meat, which indicates that it is the seed they produce that is the reason for such a high cost. Only official medicine, which is in charge of the human species, tells us nothing about improving the seed; we positively regret this delay and inform our readers that the human seed is the easiest to improve, through the permanent use of three basic foods: through what we think, what we breathe and what we eat. If we only think about vagueness, about trivial things, without importance, so will be the seed we produce because thought is decisive for said production. The young person who studies differs from the one who does not receive education in aspect and presence, there is a change in personality; The fact of breathing digested beers in bars and canteens, determines over the lives of the parishioners who frequent those places: People who feed on cakes, pork, beer, spices, alcohol, and aphrodisiac foods, live a passionate life that leads them to fornication.

Every fornicating animal is foul-smelling: donkeys, pigs, goats, and even poultry despite being birds, such as the domestic rooster. You can easily see the difference that exists between the fornicators and those that man makes chaste by force to exploit them, observe the gonads of the racehorse to those of the draft horses, between the fighting bulls and the stallions that appear daily in the press, the boar or breeding pig, even in small animals such as the rat which is tremendously passionate and its appearance is always repulsive, the same thing happens in the fornicating male who covers his stench with deodorants and perfumes. When man becomes chaste, pure, and holy, in thought, word, and deed, he recovers the lost childhood, is beautified in body and soul, and his body does not transpire foulness.

How is pre-natal education achieved? This happens between couples who follow chastity, that is, who never lose their seed in carelessness and ephemeral pleasure, thus: The spouses want to give body to a new being, they agree and ask Heaven to be guided for the event of fertilization, then in a permanent attitude of love they live together happily and festively, they take advantage of the time when nature is most generous, as the peasants do to sow, they use the process of alchemical transmutation joining together as husband and wife, which allows the escape of a strong and vigorous sperm, improved by the practices previously known and the event of divine conception is achieved by this means, once the woman perceives that she is pregnant, she separates from the man, that is, conjugal life ends, this must be done easily by the chaste man because he is full of grace and superhuman power, by all means he makes life pleasant for his wife so that she does not resort to annoyance or similar things because all of this has repercussions on the foetus that is developing, if this causes damage, what will be the union that people who have never received advice in this regard practice in a libidinous way? Which gives reasons for many children to feel terrible passions from an early age and embarrass their mothers in a scandalous way.

The mother knows that she is giving life to a new being which she keeps in her Living Temple, like a precious jewel, giving with her prayers and thoughts beautiful forms that will exalt the new creature, then comes the event of painless birth; in a simple and natural way for the glory of their parents. The couple keeps a diet that is generally forty days until the womb that served as the cradle for the new being returns to its place, the man knows that the woman who raises the child must be pampered and contemplated, with healthy caresses because any violent passionate form has repercussions on the mother's breasts and bring obstructions in the channels through which flows the precious liquid that will give life to the child of her womb, the woman who wants to put this teaching into practice will observe that the shame of having to operate on the breasts due to permanent obstructions disappears. Where there is chastity there is love and obedience, children rise up in a natural way and all evil disappears, thus begins this fundamental education for the preparation of the personality of the new being who will already go to school trained to continue the education that will allow him to live together and later earn his daily bread by himself.

In the first 7 years, the child forms his own personality, so they are as important as the months of gestation and what is expected of a being brought under such conditions is something that humans do not even suspect. Intelligence is an attribute of the Being, we have to know the Being.

The Ego cannot know the Truth because the Truth does not belong to time and the Ego does.

Fear and dread damage free initiative. Initiative is creative, fear is destructive.

By analysing everything and meditating, we awaken the sleeping conscience.

Truth is the unknown from instant to instant, it has nothing to do with what one believes or does not believe; truth is a matter of experiencing, living, understanding.
