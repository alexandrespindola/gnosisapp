On the solemn threshold of the temple of Delphi stood a hieratic inscription chiselled in living stone which read: "KNOW THYSELF". Know yourself and you will know the universe and the Gods.

The transcendental Science of Meditation has as its basic cornerstone this sacred motto of the ancient GREEK HIEROPHANTS.

If we truly and sincerely want to establish the basis for correct meditation, it is necessary to understand ourselves on all levels of the mind.

Establishing the correct basis of meditation is, in fact, being free from ambition, selfishness, fear, hatred, the craving for psychic powers, the desire for results, etc., etc., etc.

It is clear to all and beyond any doubt that after establishing the BASIC CORNERSTONE of meditation the mind becomes still and in profound and imposing silence.

From a strictly logical point of view, it is absurd to want to experience THE REAL without knowing ourselves.

It is urgent to understand in an INTEGRAL way and in all areas of the mind, each problem as it arises in the mind, each desire, each memory, each psychological defect, etc.

It is clear to all that during the practice of meditation, all the psychological defects that characterise us, all our joys and sorrows, innumerable memories, multiple impulses that come from the external world, and from the interior world, desires of all kinds, passions of all kinds, old resentments, hatreds, etc., pass through the screen of the mind in a sinister procession.

Whoever truly wants to establish in their mind the basic stone of meditation must pay full attention to these positive and negative values of our understanding and understand them in an integral way not only on the merely intellectual level, but also in all the subconscious, infraconscious and unconscious areas of the mind. We must never forget that the mind has many levels.

The in-depth study of all these values means, in fact, knowledge of oneself.

Every film on the screen of the mind has a beginning and an end. When the parade of forms, desires, passions, ambitions, memories, etc., ends, then the mind becomes still and in deep silence EMPTY of all kinds of thoughts.

Modern students of psychology need to experience the ILLUMINATING VOID. The irruption of the VOID within our own mind allows us to experience, feel, live an element that transforms, that ELEMENT is the REAL.

Distinguish between a mind that is still and a mind that is violently stilled.

Distinguish between a mind that is in silence and a mind that is forcibly silenced.

In the light of any logical deduction we have to understand that when the mind is violently stilled, in the background and on other levels it is not still and struggles to free itself.

From an analytical point of view, we have to understand that when the mind is forcibly silenced, in the background it is not silent, it screams and despairs terribly.

The true stillness and natural and spontaneous silence of the mind comes to us as a grace, as a bliss, when the very intimate film of our own existence ends on the wonderful screen of the intellect.

Only when the mind is naturally and spontaneously still, only when the mind is in delicious silence, comes the irruption of the ILLUMINATING VOID.

THE VOID is not easy to explain. It is not definable or describable, any concept that we issue about it may fail on the main point.

The VOID cannot be described or expressed in words. This is because human language has been created mainly to designate existing things, thoughts and feelings; it is not adequate to express clearly and specifically, phenomena, things and feelings that DO NOT EXIST.

Trying to discuss the VOID within the limits of a language limited by the forms of existence, really beyond any doubt, is in fact foolish and absolutely wrong.

"THE VOID is NON-EXISTENCE, and EXISTENCE IS NOT THE VOID".

"FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM THE VOID, AND THE VOID DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM".

"FORM IS VOID AND THE VOID IS FORM, IT IS DUE TO THE VOID THAT THINGS EXIST".

"THE VOID AND EXISTENCE COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND DO NOT OPPOSE". THE VOID AND EXISTENCE INCLUDE AND EMBRACE EACH OTHER.

"WHEN BEINGS OF NORMAL SENSIBILITY SEE AN OBJECT, THEY SEE ONLY ITS EXISTING ASPECT, THEY DO NOT SEE ITS VOID ASPECT".

"Every ILLUMINATED BEING can simultaneously see the existing and VOID aspect of anything.

"THE VOID is simply a term that denotes the NON-SUBSTANTIAL and non-PERSONAL nature of beings, and a sign of indication of the state of absolute detachment and freedom".

Teachers of Schools, Colleges and Universities should study our Revolutionary Psychology in depth and then teach their students the path that leads to the experimentation of the REAL.

It is only possible to arrive at the EXPERIENCE OF THE REAL when thought has ended.

The irruption of the VOID allows us to experience the CLEAR LIGHT of PURE REALITY.

That PRESENT KNOWLEDGE in reality EMPTY, without characteristic and without colour, EMPTY OF NATURE, is the TRUE REALITY, the UNIVERSAL GOODNESS.

YOUR INTELLIGENCE whose true nature is the VOID that should not be looked upon as the VOID of NOTHINGNESS but as INTELLIGENCE ITSELF unhindered, brilliant, universal and happy is CONSCIOUSNESS, the Universally Wise BUDDHA.

YOUR own EMPTY CONSCIOUSNESS and the brilliant and joyful INTELLIGENCE are inseparable. Their UNION is the DHARMA-KAYA; THE STATE OF PERFECT ILLUMINATION.

Your own BRIGHT CONSCIOUSNESS, EMPTY and inseparable from the great BODY OF SPLENDOUR, has neither BIRTH NOR DEATH and is the immutable light AMITARA BUDDHA.

This knowledge is enough. Recognising the VOID of your own INTELLIGENCE as the STATE of BUDDHA and regarding it as your own CONSCIOUSNESS, is to continue in the DIVINE SPIRIT of BUDDHA.

Keep your INTELLECT without distracting yourself during MEDITATION, forget that you are in Meditation, do not think that you are meditating because when you think you are meditating, this thought is enough to disturb the meditation. YOUR mind must remain EMPTY to experience the REAL.
