The "Great Work" is above all, the creation of man by himself, based on confidential work and voluntary suffering.

The "Great Work" is the inner conquest of ourselves, of our true freedom in God.

We urgently need, with maximum and unavoidable urgency, to disintegrate all those "Egos" that live within us if we really want the perfect emancipation of the Will.

Nicolas Flamel and Raymond Lully, both poor, liberated their will and performed countless psychological prodigies that amaze.

Agrippa never got beyond the first part of the "Great Work" and died painfully, struggling in the disintegration of his "Egos" with the purpose of possessing himself and fixing his independence.

The perfect emancipation of the will ensures the wise man absolute dominion over Fire, Air, Water and Earth.

Many students of contemporary Psychology will find what we affirm above regarding the sovereign power of the emancipated will exaggerated; However, the Bible tells us wonders about Moses.

According to Philo, Moses was an Initiate in the land of the Pharaohs on the banks of the Nile, Priest of Osiris, cousin of the Pharaoh, educated between the columns of ISIS, the Divine Mother, and OSIRIS our Father who is in secret.

Moses was a descendant of the Patriarch Abraham, the great Chaldean Magician, and the highly respectable Isaac.

Moses, the man who unleashed the electric power of will, possesses the gift of prodigies; this is known by the Divine and humans. So it is written.

Everything that the Sacred Scriptures say about that Hebrew leader is certainly extraordinary, prodigious.

Moses transforms his staff into a serpent, transforms one of his hands into a leper's hand, then restores it to life.

The test of the burning bush has made his power clear, people understand, kneel and prostrate themselves.

Moses uses a Magic Wand, emblem of royal power, of the priestly power of the Initiate in the Great Mysteries of Life and Death.

Before the Pharaoh, Moses turns the water of the Nile into blood, the fish die, the sacred river becomes infected, the Egyptians cannot drink from it, and the irrigations of the Nile spill blood through the fields.

Moses does more; he manages to make millions of disproportionate, gigantic, monstrous frogs appear, which come out of the river and invade the houses. Then, under his gesture, indicative of a free and sovereign will, those horrible frogs disappear.

But as the Pharaoh does not free the Israelites. Moses works new prodigies: he covers the earth with dirt, stirs up clouds of disgusting and filthy flies, which he then indulges in removing.

He unleashes the terrible plague, and all the flocks except those of the Jews die.

Taking soot from the oven - say the Holy Scriptures - he throws it into the air and, falling on the Egyptians, causes pustules and ulcers.

Extending his famous Magic staff, Moses makes hail rain from the sky which destroys and kills mercilessly. Then he unleashes the flaming lightning, the terrifying thunder rumbles and it rains terribly, then with a gesture he restores calm.

However, the Pharaoh remains inflexible. Moses, with a tremendous blow of his magic wand, makes clouds of locusts appear as if by magic, then darkness comes. Another blow with the staff and everything returns to its original order.

The end of that entire Biblical Drama of the Old Testament is well known: Jehovah intervenes, kills all the firstborn of the Egyptians and the Pharaoh has no choice but to let the Hebrews go.

Later Moses uses his magic wand to split the waters of the Red Sea and cross them on dry foot.

When the Egyptian warriors rush through there chasing the Israelites, Moses, with a gesture, causes the waters to close again, swallowing up the pursuers.

Undoubtedly, many Pseudo-Occultists, when reading all this, would like to do the same, to have the same powers as Moses, however, this is more than impossible as long as the Will continues bottled up among each and every one of those "Egos" that we carry in the different backgrounds of our psyche.

The Essence embedded between the "Myself" is the Genie of Aladdin's lamp, longing for freedom... Free such Genie, can perform prodigies.

The Essence is "Will-Consciousness" unfortunately processing by virtue of our own conditioning.

When the Will is freed, then it mixes or fuses, integrating with the Universal Will, thus becoming sovereign.

The individual Will fused with the Universal Will can perform all the prodigies of Moses.

There are three kinds of acts: A) Those that correspond to the Law of Accidents. B) Those that belong to the Law of Recurrence, facts always repeated in each existence. C) Actions intentionally determined by the Will-Conscious.

Undoubtedly, only people who have freed their Will through the death of the "Self" will be able to perform new acts born of their free will.

The common and ordinary acts of humanity are always the result of the Law of Recurrence or the mere product of mechanical accidents.

He who possesses Will truly free can originate new circumstances; he who has his Will bottled up between the "Pluralized Ego" is a victim of circumstances.

In all the biblical pages there is a wonderful display of High Magic, Clairvoyance, Prophecy, Prodigies, Transfigurations, Resurrection of the dead, either by insufflation or by imposition of hands or by staring at the birth of the nose, etc., etc., etc.

The Bible abounds in massage, sacred oil, magnetic passes, the application of a little saliva on the sick part, the reading of the thoughts of others, transports, apparitions, words coming from heaven, etc., etc., etc., true wonders of the Conscious Will liberated, emancipated, sovereign.

Wizards? Sorcerers? Black Magicians? They abound like weeds; but those are not Saints, nor Prophets, nor Adepts of the White Brotherhood.

No one could reach "Real Illumination", nor exercise the Absolute Priesthood of the Will-Conscious, if they had not previously died radically in themselves, here and now.

Many people frequently write to us complaining about not possessing Illumination, asking for powers, demanding keys that will turn them into Magicians, etc., etc., etc., but they are never interested in self-observing, in self-knowing, in disintegrating those psychic aggregates, those "Egos" within which the Will, the Essence, is encased.

People like that are obviously doomed to failure. They are people who covet the faculties of the Saints, but who are in no way willing to die in themselves.

Eliminating errors is something magical, wonderful in itself, which implies rigorous psychological self-observation.

Exercising powers is possible when the wonderful power of the Will is radically released.

Unfortunately, since people have their will encased between each "Ego", obviously it is divided into multiple wills that are processed each one by virtue of its own conditioning.

It is clear to understand that each "Ego" therefore possesses its own unconscious, particular will.

The innumerable wills encased between the "Egos" frequently collide with each other, making us for this reason impotent, weak, miserable, victims of circumstances, incapable.
