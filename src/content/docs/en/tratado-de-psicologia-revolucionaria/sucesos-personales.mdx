Full intimate self-observation of oneself is indispensable when it comes to discovering incorrect psychological states.

Undoubtedly, incorrect inner states can be corrected through correct procedures.

Since the inner life is the magnet that attracts outer events, we urgently need to eliminate erroneous psychological states from our psyche.

Correcting incorrect psychological states is essential when one wants to fundamentally alter the nature of certain undesirable events.

Altering our relationship with certain events is possible if we eliminate certain absurd psychological states from within.

Destructive external situations could become harmless and even constructive through the intelligent correction of erroneous inner states.

One can change the nature of unpleasant events that happen to us when one purifies oneself intimately. Whoever never corrects absurd psychological states, believing themselves to be very strong, becomes a victim of circumstances.

Putting order in our disordered inner house is vital when one wants to change the course of an unfortunate existence.

People complain about everything, suffer, cry, protest, would like to change their lives, get out of the misfortune they find themselves in, unfortunately, they do not work on themselves.

People do not want to realise that the inner life attracts outer circumstances and that if these are painful, it is due to absurd inner states.

The external is only a reflection of the internal; whoever changes internally originates a new order of things.

External events would never be as important as the way we react to them.

Did you remain calm in the face of the insulter? Did you gladly receive the unpleasant manifestations of your fellow human beings?

How did you react to the infidelity of your loved one? Did you let yourself be carried away by the poison of jealousy? Did you kill? Are you in prison?

Hospitals, cemeteries or pantheons, prisons, are full of sincerely mistaken people who reacted absurdly to external events.

The best weapon a man can use in life is a correct psychological state.

One can disarm beasts and unmask traitors through appropriate inner states.

Incorrect inner states turn us into defenseless victims of human perversity.

Learn to face the most unpleasant events of practical life with an appropriate inner attitude...

Do not identify with any event; remember that everything passes; learn to see life as a movie and you will receive the benefits...

Do not forget that events of no value could lead you to misfortune if you do not eliminate incorrect inner states from your psyche.

Each external event undoubtedly needs the appropriate ticket; that is, the precise psychological state.
