Full intimate self-observation of oneself is urgently needed when it comes to discovering mistaken psychological states. Undoubtedly, incorrect inner states can be corrected by means of correct procedures.

Since the inner life is the magnet that attracts outer events, we urgently need to eliminate erroneous psychological states from our psyche. Correcting mistaken psychological states is essential when one wants to fundamentally alter the nature of certain undesirable events.

Altering our relationship with certain events is possible if we eliminate certain absurd psychological states from within. Destructive external situations could become harmless and even constructive through the intelligent correction of erroneous inner states.

One can change the nature of unpleasant events that happen to us when one purifies oneself intimately. Whoever never corrects absurd psychological states, believing himself to be very strong, becomes a victim of circumstances.

Putting order in our disorderly inner house is vital when one wishes to change the course of an unfortunate existence. People complain about everything, suffer, cry, protest, they would like to change their life, get out of the misfortune in which they find themselves, unfortunately they do not work on themselves.

People do not want to realise that the inner life attracts external circumstances and that if these are painful, it is due to absurd inner states. The external is only the reflection of the internal; whoever changes inwardly creates a new order of things.

External events would never be as important as the way we react to them. Did you remain calm in the face of the insulter? Did you receive the unpleasant manifestations of your fellow human beings with pleasure? How did you react to the infidelity of your loved one? Did you let yourself be carried away by the poison of jealousy? Did you kill? Are you in prison?

Hospitals, cemeteries or pantheons, prisons, are full of sincere mistaken people who reacted absurdly to external events. The best weapon a person can use in life is a correct psychological state.

One can disarm beasts and unmask traitors through appropriate inner states. Mistaken inner states make us defenceless victims of human perversity. Learn to face the most unpleasant events of practical life with an appropriate inner attitude...

Do not identify with any event; remember that everything passes; learn to see life as a movie and you will receive the benefits... Do not forget that events of no value could lead you to misfortune if you do not eliminate mistaken inner states from your psyche.

Each external event undoubtedly needs the appropriate ticket; that is, the precise psychological state.
