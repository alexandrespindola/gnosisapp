As long as a person continues with the error of believing himself to be One, Unique, Individual, it is evident that radical change will be more than impossible.

The very fact that esoteric work begins with rigorous self-observation indicates a multiplicity of psychological factors, Egos or undesirable elements that urgently need to be extracted, eradicated from our interior.

Unquestionably, it would not be possible to eliminate unknown errors in any way; it is urgent to first observe that which we want to separate from our Psyche.

This type of work is not external but internal, and those who think that any book of etiquette or external and superficial ethical system can lead them to success will, in fact, be completely wrong.

The concrete and definitive fact that intimate work begins with concentrated attention on the full observation of oneself is more than enough reason to demonstrate that this requires a very particular personal effort from each of us.

Speaking frankly and without ambiguity, we assert emphatically the following: No human being could do this work for us.

No change is possible in our Psyche without the direct observation of all that set of subjective factors that we carry within.

Accepting the multiplicity of errors, discarding the need for study and direct observation of them, in fact, means an evasion or escape, a flight from oneself, a form of self-deception.

Only through the rigorous effort of judicious self-observation, without escapes of any kind, can we truly demonstrate that we are not "One" but "Many".

Admitting the plurality of the Ego and demonstrating it through rigorous observation are two different aspects.

Someone can accept the Doctrine of the many Egos without ever having demonstrated it; the latter is only possible by carefully self-observing.

Shunning the work of intimate observation, seeking evasions, is an unmistakable sign of degeneration.

As long as a man maintains the illusion that he is always one and the same person, he cannot change, and it is obvious that the purpose of this work is precisely to achieve a gradual change in our inner life.

Radical transformation is a definite possibility that is usually lost when one does not work on oneself.

The initial point of radical change remains hidden as long as man continues to believe himself to be One.

Those who reject the Doctrine of the many Egos clearly demonstrate that they have never seriously self-observed.

The severe observation of oneself without escapes of any kind allows us to verify for ourselves the crude realism that we are not "One" but "Many".

In the world of subjective opinions, various pseudo-esoteric or pseudo-occult theories always serve as an alley to flee from oneself...

Unquestionably, the illusion that one is always one and the same person serves as a stumbling block to self-observation...

Someone might say: "I know that I am not One but Many, Gnosis has taught me." Such a statement, even if it were very sincere, if there were no full lived experience on that doctrinal aspect, obviously such a statement would be something merely external and superficial.

Demonstrating, experiencing and understanding is fundamental, only then is it possible to work consciously to achieve a radical change.

Affirming is one thing and understanding is another. When someone says: "I understand that I am not One but Many," if their understanding is true and not mere insubstantial chatter of ambiguous talk, this indicates, points out, accuses, full verification of the Doctrine of the Many Egos.

Knowledge and Understanding are different. The first of these is of the mind, the second of the heart.

The mere knowledge of the Doctrine of the Many Egos is of no use; unfortunately, in these times in which we live, knowledge has gone much further than understanding because the poor intellectual animal mistakenly called man exclusively developed the side of knowledge, unfortunately forgetting the corresponding side of Being.

Knowing the Doctrine of the Many Egos and understanding it is fundamental for all true radical change.

When a man begins to observe himself carefully, from the angle that he is not One but Many, he has obviously started the serious work on his inner nature.
