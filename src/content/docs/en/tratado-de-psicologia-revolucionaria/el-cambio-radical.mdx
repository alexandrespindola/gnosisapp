As long as a man continues with the error of believing himself to be One, Unique, Indivisible, it is evident that radical change will be more than impossible. The very fact that esoteric work begins with the rigorous observation of oneself, is indicating to us a multiplicity of psychological factors, Egos or undesirable elements that it is urgent to extirpate, eradicate from our interior.

Unquestionably, in no way would it be possible to eliminate unknown errors; it is urgent to observe beforehand that which we want to separate from our psyche. This type of work is not external but internal, and those who think that any book of etiquette or external and superficial ethical system can lead them to success, will in fact be totally wrong.

The concrete and definitive fact that intimate work begins with concentrated attention on the full observation of oneself, is more than sufficient reason to demonstrate that this requires a very particular personal effort from each of us. Speaking frankly and without ambiguity, we emphatically assert the following: No human being could do this work for us.

No change is possible in our psyche without the direct observation of all that set of subjective factors that we carry within. To accept the multiplicity of errors, discarding the need for study and direct observation of them, means in fact an evasion or escape, a flight from oneself, a form of self-deception.

Only through the rigorous effort of judicious self-observation, without escapes of any kind, will we be able to really evidence that we are not "One" but "Many". Admitting the plurality of the EGO and evidencing it through rigorous observation are two different aspects.

Someone can accept the Doctrine of the many Egos without ever having evidenced it; this last is only possible by carefully self-observing. Shunning the work of intimate observation, seeking evasions, is an unmistakable sign of degeneration. While a man sustains the illusion that he is always one and the same person, he cannot change, and it is obvious that the purpose of this work is precisely to achieve a gradual change in our inner life.

Radical transformation is a defined possibility that is normally lost when one does not work on oneself. The initial point of radical change remains hidden while man continues to believe himself to be One. Those who reject the Doctrine of the many Egos clearly demonstrate that they have never seriously self-observed.

The severe observation of oneself without escapes of any kind allows us to verify for ourselves the crude realism that we are not "One" but "Many". In the world of subjective opinions, various pseudo-esoteric or pseudo-occult theories always serve as an alley to flee from oneself... Unquestionably, the illusion that one is always one and the same person serves as a stumbling block for self-observation...

Someone might say: "I know that I am not One but Many, Gnosis has taught me". Such an affirmation, even if it were very sincere, without there being full lived experience on that doctrinal aspect, obviously such an affirmation would be something merely external and superficial. Evidencing, experiencing and understanding is fundamental; only in this way is it possible to work consciously to achieve a radical change.

To affirm is one thing and to understand is another. When someone says: "I understand that I am not One but Many", if his understanding is true and not mere insubstantial verbiage of ambiguous talk, this indicates, points out, accuses, full verification of the Doctrine of the Many Egos. Knowledge and Understanding are different. The first of these is of the mind, the second of the heart.

The mere knowledge of the Doctrine of the Many Egos is of no use; unfortunately, in these times in which we live, knowledge has gone much further than understanding, because the poor intellectual animal mistakenly called man developed exclusively the side of knowledge regrettably forgetting the corresponding side of the Being. Knowing the Doctrine of the Many Egos and understanding it is fundamental for all true radical change.

When a man begins to observe himself carefully from the angle that he is not One but Many, obviously he has begun the serious work on his inner nature.
