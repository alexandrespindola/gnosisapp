To think deeply and with full attention is strange in these devolutionary and decadent times.

From the Intellectual Centre arise diverse thoughts originating, not from a permanent Self as the ignorantly enlightened foolishly suppose, but from the different "Selves" within each of Us.

When a man is thinking, he firmly believes that he himself and by himself is thinking.

The poor intellectual mammal does not want to realise that the multiple thoughts that cross his understanding originate in the different "Selves" that we carry within.

This means that we are not true thinking individuals; we do not yet really have an individual mind.

However, each of the different "Selves" that we carry within, uses our Intellectual Centre, uses it whenever it can to think.

It would be absurd, therefore, to identify with such and such a negative and harmful thought, believing it to be our particular property.

Obviously, this or that negative thought comes from whatever "Self" has abusively used our Intellectual Centre at a given moment.

Negative thoughts are of different kinds: Suspicion, distrust, ill will towards another person, passionate jealousy, religious jealousy, political jealousy, jealousy for friendships or of a family nature, greed, lust, revenge, anger, pride, envy, hatred, resentment, theft, adultery, laziness, gluttony, etc., etc., etc.

We really have so many psychological defects that even if we had a palate of steel and a thousand tongues to speak, we would not be able to enumerate them fully.

As a sequence or corollary to the foregoing, it is absurd to identify with negative thoughts.

Since it is not possible for an effect to exist without a cause, we solemnly affirm that a thought could never exist by itself, by spontaneous generation...

The relationship between thinker and thought is obvious; each negative thought has its origin in a different thinker.

In each of us there are as many negative thinkers as there are thoughts of the same kind.

Looking at this question from the pluralised angle of "Thinkers and Thoughts", it happens that each of the "Selves" that we carry in our Psyche is certainly a different thinker.

Unquestionably within each of us, there are too many thinkers; however, each of these, despite being only a part, believes itself to be the whole, at a given moment...

The mythomaniacs, the egomaniacs, the narcissists, the paranoiacs, would never accept the thesis of "The Plurality of Thinkers" because they love themselves too much, they feel like "Tarzan's dad" or "the mother hen"...

How could such abnormal people accept the idea that they do not possess an individual, brilliant, wonderful mind?...

However, such Wiseacres think the best of themselves and even dress in the tunic of Aristippus to demonstrate wisdom and humility...

The legend of the centuries tells that Aristippus, wanting to demonstrate wisdom and humility, dressed in an old tunic full of patches and holes; he grasped the Staff of Philosophy with his right hand and went through the streets of Athens...

They say that when Socrates saw him coming, he exclaimed in a loud voice: "Oh Aristippus, your vanity can be seen through the holes in your garment!".

Whoever does not always live in a state of Alert Novelty, Alert Perception, thinking that he is thinking, easily identifies with any negative thought.

As a result of this, he regrettably strengthens the sinister power of the "Negative Self", author of the corresponding thought in question.

The more we identify with a negative thought, the more slaves we will be of the corresponding "Self" that characterises it.

With respect to Gnosis, the Secret Path, the work on oneself, our particular temptations are found precisely in the "Selves" that hate Gnosis, the esoteric work, because they are not unaware that their existence within our psyche is mortally threatened by Gnosis and by the work.

These "Negative" and quarrelsome "Selves" easily seize certain mental rolls stored in our Intellectual Centre and sequentially originate harmful and detrimental mental currents.

If we accept those thoughts, those "Negative Selves" that at a given moment control our Intellectual Centre, we will then be incapable of freeing ourselves from their results.

We must never forget that every "Negative Self" "Self-Deceives" and "Deceives", conclusion: Lies.

Every time we feel a sudden loss of strength, when the aspirant is disillusioned with Gnosis, with esoteric work, when he loses enthusiasm and abandons the best, it is obvious that he has been deceived by some Negative Self.

The "Negative Self of Adultery" annihilates noble homes and makes children unhappy.

The "Negative Self of Jealousy" deceives beings who adore each other and destroys their happiness.

The "Negative Self of Mystical Pride" deceives the devotees of the Path and these, feeling wise, abhor their Master or betray him...

The Negative Self appeals to our personal experiences, to our memories, to our best yearnings, to our sincerity, and, through a rigorous selection of all this, presents something in a false light, something that fascinates and then comes failure...

However, when one discovers the "Self" in action, when one has learned to live in a state of alertness, such deception becomes impossible...
