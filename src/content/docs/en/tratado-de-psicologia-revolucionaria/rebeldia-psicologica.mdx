It's worth reminding our readers that there is a mathematical point within ourselves... Undoubtedly, such a point is never in the past, nor in the future...

Whoever wants to discover that mysterious point, must look for it here and now, within themselves, exactly at this instant, not a second ahead, nor a second behind... The two sticks, Vertical and Horizontal, of the Holy Cross, meet at this point...

We find ourselves, therefore, from instant to instant, before two paths: the Horizontal and the Vertical... It is obvious that the Horizontal is very "corny", "Vicente and all the people" walk it, "Villegas and everyone who arrives", "Don Raimundo and the whole world"...

It is evident that the Vertical is different; it is the path of intelligent rebels, that of the Revolutionaries... When one remembers oneself, when one works on oneself, when one does not identify with all the problems and sorrows of life, one is in fact going along the Vertical Path...

Certainly, it is never an easy task to eliminate negative emotions; to lose all identification with our own way of life; problems of all kinds, businesses, debts, payment of bills, mortgages, telephone, water, electricity, etc., etc., etc. The unemployed, those who for one reason or another have lost their employment, their work, obviously suffer from lack of money and forgetting their case, not worrying, nor identifying with their own problem, is in fact frighteningly difficult.

Those who suffer, those who cry, those who have been victims of some betrayal, of a bad turn in life, of ingratitude, of slander or of some fraud, really forget themselves, their real intimate Being, they identify completely with their moral tragedy...

The work on oneself is the fundamental characteristic of the Vertical Path. No one could tread the Path of the Great Rebellion, if they never worked on themselves... The work we are referring to is of a Psychological type; it deals with a certain transformation of the present moment in which we find ourselves. We need to learn to live from instant to instant...

For example, a person who is desperate because of some sentimental, economic or political problem has obviously forgotten themselves... Such a person, if they stop for an instant, if they observe the situation and try to remember themselves and then strive to understand the meaning of their attitude... If they reflect a little, if they think that everything passes; that life is illusory, fleeting and that death reduces all the vanities of the world to ashes...

If they understand that their problem at bottom is nothing more than a "flash in the pan", a will-o'-the-wisp that soon goes out, they will suddenly see with surprise that everything has changed... Transforming mechanical reactions is possible through logical confrontation and the Intimate Self-Reflection of the Being...

It is evident that people react mechanically to the various circumstances of life... Poor people! They always tend to become victims. When someone flatters them, they smile; when they are humiliated, they suffer. They insult if they are insulted; they hurt if they are hurt; they are never free; their fellow human beings have the power to take them from joy to sadness, from hope to despair.

Each of those people who go along the Horizontal Path is like a musical instrument, where each of their fellow human beings plays whatever they feel like... Whoever learns to transform mechanical relations, in fact takes the "Vertical Path". This represents a fundamental change in the "Level of Being" an extraordinary result of "Psychological Rebellion".
