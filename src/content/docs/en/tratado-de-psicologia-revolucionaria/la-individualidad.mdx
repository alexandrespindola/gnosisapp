To believe oneself to be "One" is certainly a joke in very poor taste; unfortunately, this vain illusion exists within each of us.

Sadly, we always think the best of ourselves, it never occurs to us to understand that we do not even possess true Individuality.

The worst part is that we even give ourselves the false luxury of assuming that each of us enjoys full awareness and free will.

Poor us! How foolish we are! There is no doubt that ignorance is the worst of misfortunes.

Within each of us there exist many thousands of different individuals, distinct subjects, Selves or people who quarrel among themselves, who fight for supremacy and who have no order or agreement whatsoever.

If we were aware, if we woke up from so many dreams and fantasies, how different life would be...

But to top it all off, negative emotions and self-considerations and self-love fascinate us, hypnotise us, never allowing us to remember ourselves, to see ourselves as we are.

We believe we have only one will when in reality we possess many different wills. (Each Self has its own)

The tragicomedy of all this Inner Multiplicity is terrifying; the different inner wills clash with each other, live in constant conflict, act in different directions.

If we had true Individuality, if we possessed One Unity instead of a Multiplicity, we would also have continuity of purpose, awakened consciousness, particular, individual will.

Change is what is indicated, however we must start by being honest with ourselves.

We need to take a psychological inventory of ourselves to know what we have too much of and what we lack.

It is possible to achieve Individuality, but if we believe we have it, that possibility will disappear.

It is obvious that we would never fight to achieve something we believe we have. Fantasy makes us believe that we are possessors of Individuality and there are even schools in the world that teach this.

It is urgent to fight against fantasy, it makes us appear as if we were this, or that, when in reality we are miserable, shameless and perverse.

We think we are men, when in truth we are only intellectual mammals devoid of Individuality.

Mythomaniacs believe they are Gods, Mahatmas, etc., without even suspecting that they do not even have an individual mind and Conscious Will.

Egolatry adore their beloved Ego so much that they would never accept the idea of ​​the Multiplicity of Egos within themselves.

Paranoids, with all the classic pride that characterises them, will not even read this book...

It is essential to fight to the death against the fantasy about ourselves, if we do not want to be victims of artificial emotions and false experiences that, in addition to putting us in ridiculous situations, stop all possibility of inner development.

The intellectual animal is so hypnotised by his fantasy, that he dreams that he is a lion or an eagle when in truth he is nothing more than a vile worm from the mud of the earth.

The mythomaniac would never accept these statements made above; obviously he feels like an archhierophant no matter what they say; without suspecting that fantasy is merely nothing, "nothing but fantasy".

Fantasy is a real force that acts universally on humanity and that keeps the Intellectual Humanoid in a state of sleep, causing him to believe that he is already a man, that he possesses true Individuality, will, awakened consciousness, particular mind, etc., etc., etc.

When we think we are one, we cannot move from where we are in ourselves, we remain stagnant and ultimately degenerate, devolve.

Each of us is in a certain psychological stage and we will not be able to get out of it, unless we directly discover all those people or Selves that live within our person.

It is clear that through intimate self-observation we will be able to see the people who live in our psyche and that we need to eliminate in order to achieve radical transformation.

This perception, this self-observation, fundamentally changes all the mistaken concepts we had about ourselves and as a result we evidence the concrete fact that we do not possess true Individuality.

As long as we do not self-observe, we will live in the illusion that we are One and consequently our life will be wrong.

It is not possible to relate correctly to our fellow human beings until an Inner change takes place in the depths of our psyche.

Any intimate change requires the prior elimination of the Selves that we carry within.

In no way could we eliminate such Selves if we do not observe them within us.

Those who feel One, who think the best of themselves, who would never accept the doctrine of the many, also do not want to observe the Selves and therefore any possibility of change becomes impossible in them.

It is not possible to change if it is not eliminated, but whoever feels like a possessor of Individuality if he accepts that he must eliminate, would really ignore what he must eliminate.

However, we must not forget that whoever believes he is One, self-deceived, believes that he does know what he must eliminate, but in truth he does not even know that he does not know, he is an enlightened ignoramus.

We need to "de-egoise" ourselves to "individualise" ourselves, but whoever believes that he possesses Individuality cannot possibly de-egoise himself.

Individuality is one hundred percent sacred, few are those who have it, but everyone thinks they have it.

How could we eliminate "Selves", if we believe that we have a Unique "Self"?

Certainly, only someone who has never seriously Self-Observed thinks that he has a Unique Self.

But we must be very clear in this teaching because there is the psychological danger of confusing authentic Individuality with the concept of some kind of "Higher Self" or something like that.

Sacred Individuality is far beyond any form of "Self", it is what it is, what it has always been and what it will always be.

Legitimate Individuality is the Being and the reason for Being of the Being, it is the Being itself.

Distinguish between Being and Self. Those who confuse the Self with the Being, certainly have never seriously self-observed.

As long as the Essence, the consciousness, continues, bottled up among all that set of Selves that we carry within, radical change will be something more than Impossible.
