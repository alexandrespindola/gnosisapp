If we carefully observe any day of our lives, we will see that we certainly do not know how to live consciously.

Our life seems like a moving train, running on the fixed tracks of mechanical, rigid habits, in a vain and superficial existence.

The curious thing is that it never occurs to us to modify our habits; it seems we never tire of always repeating the same things.

Habits have petrified us, yet we think we are free; we are frightfully ugly but believe ourselves to be Apollo.

We are mechanical people, which is more than enough reason to lack any true feeling for what we are doing in life.

We move daily within the old track of our outdated and absurd habits, and thus it is clear that we do not have a true life; instead of living, we vegetate miserably and do not receive new impressions.

If a person were to start their day consciously, it is evident that such a day would be very different from other days.

When one takes the totality of one's life as the very day one is living, when one does not leave for tomorrow what should be done today, one truly comes to know what it means to work on oneself.

No day lacks importance; if we truly want to transform ourselves radically, we must see ourselves, observe ourselves, and understand ourselves daily.

However, people do not want to see themselves; some, wanting to work on themselves, justify their negligence with phrases such as: "Work in the office does not allow one to work on oneself." These are meaningless, hollow, vain, absurd words that only serve to justify indolence, laziness, and lack of love for the Great Cause.

People like this, even if they have many spiritual concerns, obviously will never change.

Observing ourselves is urgent, unpostponable, and unavoidable. Intimate Self-Observation is fundamental for true change.

What is your psychological state upon waking? What is your mood during breakfast? Were you impatient with the waiter? With your wife? Why were you impatient? What always disturbs you?, etc.

Smoking or eating less is not all the change, but it does indicate some progress. We know well that vice and gluttony are inhuman and beastly.

It is not good for someone dedicated to the Secret Path to have an excessively fat physical body with a protruding belly and lacking all eurhythmic perfection. This would indicate gluttony, greed, and even laziness.

Daily life, profession, employment, although vital for existence, constitute the sleep of consciousness.

Knowing that life is a dream does not mean having understood it. Understanding comes with self-observation and intense work on oneself.

To work on oneself, it is indispensable to work on one's daily life, today, and then one will understand the meaning of that phrase from the Lord's Prayer: "Give us this day our daily bread."

The phrase "Each Day" means the "supersubstantial bread" in Greek or the "bread from above."

Gnosis gives that Bread of Life in the double sense of ideas and forces that allow us to disintegrate psychological errors.

Each time we reduce to cosmic dust such or such an 'I', we gain psychological experience, we eat the "Bread of Wisdom," we receive new knowledge.

Gnosis offers us the "Supersubstantial Bread," the "Bread of Wisdom," and precisely indicates the new life that begins within oneself, here and now.

Now, no one can alter their life or change anything related to the mechanical reactions of existence unless they have the help of new ideas and receive Divine assistance.

Gnosis provides these new ideas and teaches the "modus operandi" by which one can be assisted by Forces Superior to the mind.

We need to prepare the lower centers of our organism to receive the ideas and forces that come from the Superior centers.

In the work on oneself, nothing is despicable. Any thought, no matter how insignificant, deserves to be observed. Any negative emotion, reaction, etc., must be observed.
