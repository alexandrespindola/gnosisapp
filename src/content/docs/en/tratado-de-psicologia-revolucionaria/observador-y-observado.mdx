It is very clear and not difficult to understand that when someone begins to observe themselves seriously from the point of view that they are not One but Many, they really begin to work on everything they carry inside.

The following psychological defects are an obstacle, hindrance, stumbling block, to the work of Intimate Self-observation: Mythomania (Delusions of Grandeur, believing oneself to be a God), Egotism (Belief in a Permanent Self; adoration of any kind of Alter-Ego), Paranoia (Know-it-all attitude, Self-sufficiency, conceit, believing oneself to be infallible, mystical pride, a person who cannot see another's point of view).

When one continues with the absurd conviction that one is One, that one possesses a permanent Self, serious work on oneself becomes more than impossible. Whoever always believes they are One will never be able to separate themselves from their own undesirable elements. They will consider each thought, feeling, desire, emotion, passion, affection, etc., etc., etc., as different, unmodifiable functionalisms of their own nature, and will even justify themselves to others by saying that such and such personal defects are hereditary...

Whoever accepts the Doctrine of the Many Selves understands, based on observation, that each desire, thought, action, passion, etc., corresponds to this or that distinct, different Self... Any athlete of intimate Self-observation works very seriously within themselves and strives to remove from their psyche the various undesirable elements they carry within...

If one truly and sincerely begins to observe themselves internally, one ends up dividing into two: Observer and Observed. If such a division did not occur, it is evident that we would never take a step forward on the marvellous Path of Self-Knowledge. How could we observe ourselves if we make the mistake of not wanting to divide ourselves between Observer and Observed?

If such a division does not occur, it is obvious that we will never take a step forward on the path of Self-Knowledge. Undoubtedly, when this division does not happen, we remain identified with all the processes of the Pluralised Self... Whoever identifies with the various processes of the Pluralised Self is always a victim of circumstances.

How could someone who does not know themselves modify circumstances? How could someone who has never observed themselves internally know themselves? How could someone self-observe if they do not first divide themselves into Observer and Observed?

Now, no one can begin to change radically until they are able to say: "This desire is an animal Self that I must eliminate"; "this selfish thought is another Self that torments me and that I need to disintegrate"; "this feeling that hurts my heart is an intrusive Self that I need to reduce to cosmic dust"; etc., etc., etc. Naturally, this is impossible for someone who has never divided themselves between Observer and Observed.

Whoever takes all their psychological processes as functionalisms of a Single, Individual and Permanent Self is so identified with all their errors, has them so bound to themselves, that they have lost the ability to separate them from their psyche. Obviously, such people can never change radically; they are people condemned to utter failure.
