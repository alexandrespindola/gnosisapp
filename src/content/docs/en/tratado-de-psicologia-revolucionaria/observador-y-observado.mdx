It is very clear and not difficult to understand that when someone begins to observe themselves seriously from the point of view that they are not One but Many, they really begin to work on all that they carry within.

The following psychological defects are obstacles, hindrances, stumbling blocks to the work of Intimate Self-Observation: Mythomania, (Delusions of Grandeur, believing oneself to be a God) Egolatry, (Belief in a Permanent Self; adoration of any kind of Alter-Ego) Paranoia. (Know-it-all attitude, Self-sufficiency, conceit, believing oneself infallible, mystical pride, a person who cannot see the point of view of others)

When one continues with the absurd conviction that one is One, that one possesses a permanent Self, serious work on oneself becomes more than impossible.

Whoever always believes they are One will never be able to separate themselves from their own undesirable elements. They will consider each thought, feeling, desire, emotion, passion, affection, etc., etc., etc., as different, unchangeable functionalisms of their own nature and will even justify themselves to others by saying that such and such personal defects are hereditary...

Whoever accepts the Doctrine of the Many Selves understands, based on observation, that each desire, thought, action, passion, etc., corresponds to this or that distinct, different Self...

Any athlete of Intimate Self-Observation works very seriously within themselves and strives to remove from their psyche the various undesirable elements they carry within...

If one truly and very sincerely begins to observe themselves internally, they end up dividing into two: Observer and Observed.

If such a division did not occur, it is evident that we would never take a step forward on the wonderful Path of Self-Knowledge.

How could we observe ourselves if we make the mistake of not wanting to divide ourselves between Observer and Observed?

If such a division did not occur, it is obvious that we would never take a step forward on the path of Self-Knowledge.

Undoubtedly, when this division does not happen, we continue to be identified with all the processes of the Pluralized Self...

Whoever identifies with the various processes of the Pluralized Self is always a victim of circumstances.

How could someone who does not know themselves modify circumstances? How could someone know themselves who has never observed themselves internally? How could someone self-observe if they do not first divide themselves into Observer and Observed?

Now, no one can begin to change radically until they are able to say: "This desire is an animal Self that I must eliminate"; "this selfish thought is another Self that torments me and that I need to disintegrate"; "this feeling that hurts my heart is an intrusive Self that I need to reduce to cosmic dust"; etc., etc., etc.

Naturally, this is impossible for someone who has never divided themselves between Observer and Observed.

Whoever takes all their psychological processes as functionalisms of a Single, Individual, and Permanent Self is so identified with all their errors, has them so tied to themselves, that they have lost the ability to separate them from their psyche.

Obviously, people like this can never change radically, they are people condemned to the most resounding failure.
