Observation, Judgement and Execution are the three basic factors of dissolution.

First: observe. Second: judge. Third: execute.

Spies in war are first observed; second they are judged; third they are shot.

In inter-relationship there is self-discovery and self-revelation. Whoever renounces coexistence with their fellow beings, also renounces self-discovery.

Any incident in life, however insignificant it may seem, undoubtedly has as its cause an intimate actor within us, a psychic aggregate, an "I".

Self-discovery is possible when we are in a state of alert perception, alert novelty.

An "I", caught red-handed, must be carefully observed in our brain, heart and sex.

An "I" of lust could manifest in the heart as love, in the brain as an Ideal, but when paying attention to sex, we would feel a certain unmistakable morbid excitement.

The judgement of any "I" must be definitive. We need to seat it in the dock and judge it mercilessly.

Any evasion, justification, consideration, must be eliminated, if we truly want to become aware of the "I" that we yearn to extirpate from our psyche.

Execution is different; it would not be possible to execute any "I" without having previously observed and judged it.

Prayer in psychological work is fundamental for dissolution. We need a power superior to the mind, if we really want to disintegrate this or that "I".

The mind by itself could never disintegrate any "I", this is irrefutable, undeniable.

To pray is to talk to God. We must appeal to God Mother in Our Intimacy, if we truly want to disintegrate "I's", whoever does not love their Mother, the ungrateful child, will fail in the work on themselves.

Each of us has their own particular, individual Divine Mother, she in herself is a part of our own Being, but derived.

All ancient peoples worshipped "God Mother" in the depths of our Being. The feminine principle of the Eternal is ISIS, MARY, TONANZIN, CIBELES, REA, ADONIA, INSOBERTA, etc., etc., etc.

If in the merely physical we have a father and mother, in the depths of our Being we also have our Father who is in secret and our Divine Mother KUNDALINI.

There are as many Fathers in Heaven as there are men on earth. God Mother in our own intimacy is the feminine aspect of our Father who is in secret.

HE and SHE are certainly the two superior parts of our Intimate Being. Undoubtedly HE and SHE are our Real Being beyond the "I" of Psychology.

HE unfolds into SHE and commands, directs, instructs. SHE eliminates the undesirable elements that we carry within us, on the condition of continuous work on oneself.

When we have died radically, when all the undesirable elements have been eliminated after many conscious works and voluntary sufferings, we will merge and integrate with the "FATHER-MOTHER", then we will be terribly divine Gods, beyond good and evil.

Our particular, individual Divine Mother, through her fiery powers can reduce to cosmic dust any of those many "I's" that have been previously observed and judged.

In no way would a specific formula be necessary to pray to our inner Divine Mother. We must be very natural and simple when addressing HER. The child who addresses their mother never has special formulas, they say what comes from their heart and that's it.

No "I" dissolves instantaneously; our Divine Mother must work and even suffer a great deal before achieving the annihilation of any "I".

Become introverted, direct your prayer inwards, seeking within your interior your Divine Lady and with sincere pleas you can speak to her. Ask her to disintegrate that "I" that you have previously observed and judged.

The sense of intimate self-observation, as it develops, will allow you to verify the progressive advance of your work.

Understanding, discernment, are fundamental, however something more is needed if we really want to disintegrate the "MYSELF".

The mind can afford to label any defect, move it from one department to another, exhibit it, hide it, etc., but it could never fundamentally alter it.

A "special power" superior to the mind is needed, a fiery power capable of reducing any defect to ashes.

STELLA MARIS, our Divine Mother, has that power, she can pulverise any psychological defect.

Our Divine Mother lives in our intimacy, beyond the body, affections and mind. She is in herself an igneous power superior to the mind.

Our particular, individual Cosmic Mother, possesses Wisdom, Love and Power. In her there is absolute perfection.

Good intentions and the constant repetition of them, are of no use, lead to nothing.

It would be useless to repeat: "I will not be lustful"; the "I's" of lasciviousness would continue to exist in the very depths of our psyche.

It would be useless to repeat daily: "I will have no more anger". The "I's" of anger would continue to exist in our psychological depths.

It would be useless to say daily: "I will no longer be greedy". The "I's" of greed would continue to exist in the various backgrounds of our psyche.

It would be useless to separate ourselves from the world and lock ourselves in a convent or live in some cave; the "I's" inside us would continue to exist.

Some cave-dwelling anchorites, based on rigorous disciplines, reached the ecstasy of the saints and were taken to the heavens, where they saw and heard things that human beings are not able to understand; however, the "I's" continued to exist within them.

Unquestionably the Essence can escape from the "I" on the basis of rigorous disciplines and enjoy ecstasy, however, after the bliss, it returns to the interior of the "Myself".

Those who have become accustomed to ecstasy, without having dissolved the "Ego", believe that they have already achieved liberation, they self-deceive themselves believing they are Masters and even enter submerged Involution.

We would never pronounce ourselves against mystical rapture, against ecstasy and the happiness of the Soul in the absence of the EGO.

We only want to emphasise the need to dissolve "I's" to achieve final liberation.

The Essence of any disciplined anchorite, accustomed to escaping from the "I", repeats such a feat after the death of the physical body, enjoys ecstasy for a time and then returns like the Genie from Aladdin's lamp to the inside of the bottle, to the Ego, to the Myself.

Then they have no choice but to return to a new physical body, with the purpose of repeating their life on the carpet of existence.

Many mystics who died in the caves of the Himalayas, in Central Asia, are now vulgar, ordinary people in this world, even though their followers still adore and venerate them.

Any attempt at liberation, however grand it may be, if it does not take into account the need to dissolve the Ego, is doomed to failure.
