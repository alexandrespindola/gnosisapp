The time has come to reflect very seriously on that thing called "internal consideration".

There is no doubt about the disastrous aspect of "intimate self-consideration"; besides hypnotising the consciousness, it makes us lose a great deal of energy.

If one did not make the mistake of identifying so much with oneself, inner self-consideration would be more than impossible.

When one identifies with oneself, one loves oneself too much, feels sorry for oneself, self-considers, thinks that one has always behaved very well with so-and-so, with what's-his-name, with the wife, with the children, etc., and that no one has been able to appreciate it, etc. In short, one is a saint and everyone else is evil, a rogue.

One of the most common forms of intimate self-consideration is worrying about what others may think about oneself; perhaps they assume that we are not honest, sincere, truthful, brave, etc.

The most curious thing about all this is that we lamentably ignore the enormous loss of energy that this kind of worry brings us.

Many hostile attitudes towards certain people who have done us no harm, are precisely due to such worries born of intimate self-consideration.

In these circumstances, loving oneself so much, self-considering in this way, it is clear that the I, or rather the I's, instead of being extinguished, are then strengthened frightfully.

Identified with oneself, one feels very sorry for one's own situation and even starts calculating.

This is how one thinks that so-and-so, that what's-his-name, that the mate, that the friend, that the neighbour, that the boss, that the friend, etc., etc., etc., have not paid one as they should have, despite all one's well-known goodness, and bottled up in this, one becomes unbearable and boring for everyone.

With such a subject, you practically cannot talk because any conversation is sure to end up in their little book of accounts and their so much talked-about sufferings.

It is written that in Gnostic esoteric work, soulful growth is only possible through forgiveness to others.

If someone lives from moment to moment, suffering for what they are owed, for what they were done to, for the bitterness they were caused, always with their same song, nothing can grow inside them.

The Lord's Prayer has said: "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors".

The feeling that one is owed, the pain for the wrongs that others have caused, etc., stops all inner progress of the soul.

Jesus the Great KABIR, said: "Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the way, lest the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Assuredly, I say to you, you will not come out from there till you have paid the last quadrant". (Matthew, V, 25, 26)

If we are owed, we owe. If we demand to be paid to the last penny, we must pay before to the last quadrant.

This is the "Law of Talion", "Eye for eye and tooth for tooth". "Vicious circle", absurd.

The apologies, the complete satisfaction and the humiliations that we demand from others for the wrongs they have caused us, are also demanded from us, even if we consider ourselves meek sheep.

Placing oneself under unnecessary laws is absurd, it is better to put oneself under new influences.

The Law of Mercy is a higher influence than the Law of the violent man: "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth".

It is urgent, indispensable, unavoidable, to intelligently place ourselves under the wonderful influences of Gnostic esoteric work, to forget that we are owed and to eliminate in our psyche any form of self-consideration.

We must never admit within ourselves, feelings of revenge, resentment, negative emotions, anxieties for the wrongs they have caused us, violence, envy, incessant remembrance of debts, etc., etc., etc.

Gnosis is destined for those sincere aspirants who truly want to work and change.

If we observe people, we can directly see that each person has their own song.

Each one sings their own psychological song; I want to refer emphatically to the question of psychological accounts; feeling that one is owed, complaining, self-considering, etc.

Sometimes people "sing their song, just because", without being wound up, without being encouraged, and at other times after a few glasses of wine...

We say that our boring song must be eliminated; it incapacitates us internally, steals a lot of energy from us.

In matters of Revolutionary Psychology, someone who sings too well - we are not referring to the beautiful voice, nor to the physical singing - certainly cannot go beyond themselves; they remain in the past...

A person hindered by sad songs cannot change their Level of Being; they cannot go beyond what they are.

To pass to a Higher Level of Being, it is necessary to stop being what one is; we need not to be what we are.

If we continue to be what we are, we can never pass to a Higher Level of Being.

In the field of practical life, unusual things happen. Very often any person befriends another, only because it is easy for them to sing their song.

Unfortunately, such relationships end when the singer is asked to shut up, to change the record, to talk about something else, etc.

Then the resentful singer goes in search of a new friend, of someone who is willing to listen to them for an indefinite time.

Understanding is demanded by the singer, someone who understands them, as if it were so easy to understand another person.

To understand another person, it is necessary to understand oneself.

Unfortunately, the good singer believes that they understand themselves.

There are many disappointed singers who sing the song of not being understood and dream of a wonderful world where they are the central figures.

However, not all singers are public, there are also reserved ones; they do not sing their song directly, but secretly sing it.

They are people who have worked a lot, who have suffered too much, feel defrauded, think that life owes them everything that they were never able to achieve.

They usually feel an inner sadness, a sensation of monotony and appalling boredom, intimate fatigue or frustration around which thoughts pile up.

Unquestionably, secret songs block our path on the road to the intimate self-realisation of the Being.

Unfortunately, such secret inner songs go unnoticed to themselves unless we intentionally observe them.

Obviously, all self-observation allows light to penetrate into oneself, into one's intimate depths.

No inner change could occur in our psyche unless it is brought to the light of self-observation.

It is essential to observe oneself when alone, as well as when in relation to people.

When one is alone, very different "I's", very different thoughts, negative emotions, etc., appear.

One is not always well accompanied when one is alone. It is only normal, it is very natural, to be very badly accompanied in full solitude. The most negative and dangerous "I's" appear when one is alone.

If we want to transform ourselves radically, we need to sacrifice our own sufferings.

Many times we express our sufferings in articulated or inarticulate songs.
