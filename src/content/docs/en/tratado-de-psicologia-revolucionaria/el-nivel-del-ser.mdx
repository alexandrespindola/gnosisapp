Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? What are we living for? Why are we living?...

Undeniably, the poor "Intellectual Animal" mistakenly called man, not only doesn't know, but also doesn't even know that he doesn't know...

The worst of all is the difficult and strange situation we find ourselves in, we ignore the secret of all our tragedies and yet we are convinced that we know everything...

Take a "Rational Mammal", one of those people who in life presume to be influential, to the centre of the SAHARA desert, leave them there far from any oasis and observe from an aerial ship everything that happens...

The facts will speak for themselves; the "Intellectual Humanoid" although presuming to be strong and believes himself to be very much a man, in the end turns out to be frighteningly weak...

The "Rational Animal" is one hundred per cent stupid; he thinks the best of himself; he believes that he can function wonderfully through KINDERGARTEN, Books of Etiquette, Primary, Secondary, High School, University, the good reputation of his father, etc., etc., etc.

Unfortunately, after so many letters and good manners, titles and money, we know very well that any stomach ache makes us sad and that deep down we continue to be unhappy and miserable...

It is enough to read Universal History to know that we are the same barbarians as before and that instead of improving we have become worse...

This 20th century with all its spectacularity, wars, prostitution, worldwide sodomy, sexual degeneration, drugs, alcohol, exorbitant cruelty, extreme perversity, monstrosity, etc., etc., etc., is the mirror in which we must look at ourselves; there is therefore no good reason to boast of having reached a superior stage of development...

To think that time means progress is absurd, unfortunately the "enlightened ignoramuses" continue to be bottled up in the "Dogma of Evolution"...

In all the black pages of "Black History" we always find the same horrible cruelties, ambitions, wars, etc.

However, our "Super-civilised" contemporaries are still convinced that this thing about War is something secondary, a passing accident that has nothing to do with their so-called "Modern Civilisation"

Certainly what matters is the way each person is; some subjects will be drunks, others teetotallers, some honest and others scoundrels; there is everything in life...

The mass is the sum of the individuals; what the individual is, the mass is, the Government is, etc.

The mass is therefore the extension of the individual; the transformation of the masses, of the peoples, is not possible if the individual, if each person, does not transform...

No one can deny that there are different social levels; there are people from the church and the brothel; from commerce and the countryside, etc., etc., etc.

So too there are different Levels of Being. What we are internally, splendid or petty, generous or stingy, violent or peaceful, chaste or lustful, attracts the various circumstances of life...

A lustful person will always attract scenes, dramas and even tragedies of lasciviousness in which he will be involved...

A drunkard will attract drunkards and will always be involved in bars and cantinas, that is obvious...

What will the usurer, the selfish person, attract? How many problems, prisons, misfortunes?

However, people who are bitter, tired of suffering, want to change, to turn the page of their history...

Poor people! They want to change and they don't know how; they don't know the procedure; they are stuck in a dead end...

What happened to them yesterday happens to them today and will happen to them tomorrow; they always repeat the same mistakes and do not learn the lessons of life even with cannons.

All things are repeated in their own lives; they say the same things, they do the same things, they lament the same things...

This boring repetition of dramas, comedies and tragedies, will continue as long as we carry inside us the undesirable elements of Wrath, Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, Sloth, Gluttony, etc., etc., etc.

What is our moral level? Or better we should say: What is our Level of Being?

While the Level of Being does not change radically, the repetition of all our miseries, scenes, misfortunes and misfortunes will continue...

All things, all circumstances, that happen outside of us, on the stage of this world, are exclusively the reflection of what we carry inside.

With just reason we can solemnly assert that "the exterior is the reflection of the interior".

When one changes internally and such change is radical, the exterior, the circumstances, life, also change.

I have been observing for some time, (Year 1974), a group of people who invaded someone else's land. Here in Mexico such people receive the curious qualification of "PARACHUTISTS".

They are neighbours of the Campestre Churubusco neighbourhood, they are very close to my house, which is why I have been able to study them closely...

Being poor can never be a crime, but the serious thing is not that, but their Level of Being...

They fight among themselves daily, they get drunk, they insult each other, they become murderers of their own companions in misfortune, they certainly live in filthy huts within which instead of love reigns hatred...

Many times I have thought that if any subject of those, eliminated from his interior the hatred, the wrath, the lust, the drunkenness, the slander, the cruelty, the selfishness, the calumny, the envy, the self-love, the pride, etc., etc., etc., he would be liked by other people, he would associate by simple Law of Psychological Affinities with more refined, more spiritual people; those new relationships would be definitive for an economic and social change...

That would be the system that would allow such a subject, to abandon the "garage", the "filthy sewer"...

So, if we really want a radical change, what we must first understand is that each one of us (whether white or black, yellow or brown, ignorant or enlightened, etc.), is at such or such "Level of Being".

What is our Level of Being? Have you ever reflected on that? It would not be possible to move to another level if we ignore the state in which we find ourselves.
