Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going? What do we live for? Why do we live?...

Unquestionably, the poor "Intellectual Animal", mistakenly called man, not only doesn't know, but also doesn't even know that he doesn't know... The worst of all is the difficult and strange situation in which we find ourselves; we ignore the secret of all our tragedies and yet we are convinced that we know everything...

Take a "Rational Mammal", one of those people who in life presume to be influential, to the centre of the Sahara desert, leave them there far from any Oasis and observe from an aircraft everything that happens... The facts will speak for themselves; the "Intellectual Humanoid", although presuming to be strong and believing himself to be very much a man, is actually frighteningly weak...

The "Rational Animal" is one hundred percent foolish; he thinks the best of himself; he believes that he can develop wonderfully through Kindergarten, Manuals of Etiquette, Primary School, Secondary School, A-Levels, University, the good reputation of his father, etc., etc., etc. Unfortunately, after so many letters and good manners, titles and money, we well know that any stomach ache saddens us and that deep down we continue to be unhappy and miserable...

It is enough to read Universal History to know that we are the same barbarians as before and that instead of improving we have become worse... This 20th century with all its spectacularity, wars, prostitution, world sodomy, sexual degeneration, drugs, alcohol, exorbitant cruelty, extreme perversity, monstrosity, etc., etc., etc., is the mirror in which we should look at ourselves; there is therefore no compelling reason to boast of having reached a superior stage of development...

To think that time means progress is absurd, unfortunately the "enlightened ignoramuses" continue to be bottled up in the "Dogma of Evolution"... On all the black pages of "Black History" we always find the same horrific cruelties, ambitions, wars, etc. However, our "Super-civilised" contemporaries are still convinced that this thing of War is something secondary, a passing accident that has nothing to do with their so-called "Modern Civilisation".

Certainly what matters is the way of being of each person; some subjects will be drunkards, others teetotallers, those honest and these others rogues; there is everything in life... The mass is the sum of the individuals; what the individual is, the mass is, the Government is, etc. The mass is therefore the extension of the individual; the transformation of the masses, of the peoples, is not possible if the individual, if each person, does not transform...

No one can deny that there are different social levels; there are people from the church and the brothel; from commerce and the countryside, etc., etc., etc. There are also different Levels of Being. What we are internally, splendid or petty, generous or stingy, violent or peaceful, chaste or lustful, attracts the various circumstances of life...

A lustful person will always attract scenes, dramas and even tragedies of lewdness in which he will find himself involved... A drunkard will attract drunkards and will always find himself in bars and taverns, that is obvious... What will the usurer, the selfish person, attract? How many problems, prisons, misfortunes?

However, embittered people, tired of suffering, want to change, to turn the page of their history... Poor people! They want to change and they don't know how; they don't know the procedure; they are stuck in a dead end... What happened to them yesterday happens to them today and will happen to them tomorrow; they always repeat the same mistakes and do not learn the lessons of life even with a cannon.

All things are repeated in their own life; they say the same things, they do the same things, they lament the same things... This boring repetition of dramas, comedies and tragedies, will continue as long as we carry within us the undesirable elements of Wrath, Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, Sloth, Gluttony, etc., etc., etc.

What is our moral level? Or rather: What is our Level of Being? While the Level of Being does not change radically, the repetition of all our miseries, scenes, misfortunes and calamities will continue... All things, all circumstances, that happen outside of us, on the stage of this world, are exclusively the reflection of what we carry internally.

With good reason we can solemnly assert that "the exterior is the reflection of the interior". When one changes internally and such change is radical, the exterior, the circumstances, life, also change.

I have been observing for some time (Year 1974), a group of people who invaded someone else's land. Here in Mexico such people receive the curious qualification of "PARACHUTISTS". They are neighbours of the Campestre Churubusco neighbourhood, they are very close to my house, which is why I have been able to study them closely...

Being poor can never be a crime, but the serious thing is not that, but their Level of Being... They fight among themselves daily, they get drunk, they insult each other, they become murderers of their own companions of misfortune, they live certainly in filthy huts within which instead of love reigns hatred...

Many times I have thought that if any of those subjects eliminated from their interior the hatred, the wrath, the lust, the drunkenness, the slander, the cruelty, the selfishness, the calumny, the envy, the self-love, the pride, etc., etc., etc., they would be liked by other people, they would associate by simple Law of Psychological Affinities with more refined, more spiritual people; these new relationships would be definitive for an economic and social change...

That would be the system that would allow such a subject to abandon the "garage", the filthy "sewer"... So, if we really want a radical change, what we must first understand is that each of us (whether white or black, yellow or copper-coloured, ignorant or enlightened, etc.), is at such or such "Level of Being".

What is our Level of Being? Have you ever reflected on that? It would not be possible to move to another level if we ignore the state in which we find ourselves.
