In the realm of practical life, we always discover contrasts that are astonishing. Wealthy people with magnificent residences and many friends sometimes suffer terribly... Humble labourers or people from the middle class often live in complete happiness.

Many multi-millionaires suffer from sexual impotence, and rich matrons bitterly weep over their husband's infidelity... The rich of the earth seem like vultures in golden cages; these days, they cannot live without "bodyguards"... Statesmen drag chains; they are never free, and they walk everywhere surrounded by people armed to the teeth...

Let us study this situation more carefully. We need to know what life is. Everyone is free to have their own opinion... Say what they may, certainly no one knows anything; life is a problem that no one understands...

When people want to tell us the story of their life for free, they cite events, names and surnames, dates, etc., and they feel satisfaction in making their accounts... These poor people are unaware that their stories are incomplete because events, names and dates are only the external aspect of the film; the internal aspect is missing...

It is urgent to know "states of consciousness"; to each event corresponds this or that state of mind. States are internal, and events are external; external events are not everything...

Understand by internal states the good or bad dispositions, worries, depression, superstition, fear, suspicion, mercy, self-consideration, overestimation of oneself; states of feeling happy, states of joy, etc., etc., etc.

Unquestionably, the internal states can correspond exactly with the external events or be originated by them, or have no relation to them... In any case, states and events are different. Events do not always correspond exactly with related states.

The internal state of a pleasant event might not correspond with it. The internal state of an unpleasant event might not correspond with it. Events awaited for a long time, when they came, we felt that something was missing...

Certainly, the corresponding internal state that should have combined with the external event was missing... Many times, the event that was not expected turns out to be the one that has provided us with the best moments...
