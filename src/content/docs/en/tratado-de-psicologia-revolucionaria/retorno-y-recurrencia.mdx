A man is what his life is; if a man doesn't modify anything within himself, if he doesn't radically transform his life, if he doesn't work on himself, he is miserably wasting his time.

Death is the return to the very beginning of his life with the possibility of repeating it again.

Much has been said in pseudo-esoteric and pseudo-occult literature about the subject of successive lives; it is better that we concern ourselves with successive existences.

Each of our lives, with all its times, is always the same, repeating itself from existence to existence, through the innumerable centuries.

Unquestionably, we continue in the seed of our descendants; this is something that has already been demonstrated.

Each of our lives, in particular, is a living film that we take with us into eternity when we die.

Each of us takes their film and brings it back to project it again on the screen of a new existence.

The repetition of dramas, comedies, and tragedies is a fundamental axiom of the Law of Recurrence.

In each new existence, the same circumstances are always repeated. The actors in such repeatedly performed scenes are those people who live within us, the "Egos".

If we disintegrate those actors, those "Egos" that originate the ever-repeated scenes of our life, then the repetition of such circumstances would become more than impossible.

Obviously, without actors, there can be no scenes; this is something irrefutable, undeniable.

This is how we can free ourselves from the Laws of Return and Recurrence; this is how we can truly become free.

Obviously, each of the characters (Egos) that we carry within us repeats the same role from existence to existence; if we disintegrate it, if the actor dies, the role concludes.

Reflecting seriously on the Law of Recurrence or repetition of scenes in each Return, we discover, through intimate self-observation, the secret springs of this question.

If in the past existence at the age of twenty-five (25) years, we had a love affair, it is Indubitable that the "Ego" of such a commitment will seek the lady of his dreams at the age of twenty-five (25) years in the new existence.

If the lady in question then was only fifteen (15) years old, the "Ego" of such an adventure will seek her beloved in the new existence at the same exact age.

It becomes clear to understand that the two "Egos," both his and hers, seek each other telepathically and reunite again to repeat the same love affair from the past existence...

Two enemies who fought to the death in the past existence will seek each other again in the new existence to repeat their tragedy at the corresponding age.

If two people had a dispute over real estate at the age of forty (40) years in the past existence, at the same age, they will seek each other telepathically in the new existence to repeat the same thing.

Within each of us live many people full of commitments; that is irrefutable.

A thief carries within him a cave of thieves with various criminal commitments. The murderer carries within himself a "club" of murderers, and the lustful person carries in his psyche a "House of Appointments."

The serious thing about all this is that the intellect ignores the existence of such people or "Egos" within itself and of such commitments that are fatally being fulfilled.

All these commitments of the Egos that dwell within us occur below our reason.

They are facts that we ignore, things that happen to us, events that are processed in the subconscious and unconscious.

With good reason, we have been told that everything happens to us, like when it rains or when it thunders.

We really have the illusion of doing, but we do nothing; it happens to us; this is fatal, mechanical...

Our personality is only the instrument of different people (Egos), through which each of those people (Egos) fulfills their commitments.

Many things happen below our cognitive capacity; unfortunately, we ignore what happens below our poor reason.

We believe we are wise when in truth we do not even know that we do not know.

We are miserable logs, dragged by the raging waves of the sea of existence.

Getting out of this misfortune, this unconsciousness, the so lamentable state in which we find ourselves, is only possible by dying in ourselves...

How could we wake up without dying first? Only with death does the new come! If the seed does not die, the plant is not born.

He who truly awakens acquires for that reason full objectivity of his consciousness, authentic illumination, happiness...
