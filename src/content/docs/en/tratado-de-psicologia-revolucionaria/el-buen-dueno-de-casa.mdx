To distance oneself from the disastrous effects of life, in these dark times, is certainly very difficult but indispensable, otherwise one is devoured by life.

Any work one does on oneself with the purpose of achieving spiritual and soulful development is always related to isolation, well understood, because under the influence of life as we always live it, it is not possible to develop anything other than the personality.

In no way do we intend to oppose the development of the personality; obviously this is necessary in existence, but it is certainly something merely artificial, it is not the true, the real in us.

If the poor intellectual mammal mistakenly called man does not isolate himself, but identifies with all the events of practical life and squanders his forces on negative emotions and personal self-considerations and vain, insubstantial verbiage of ambiguous, unedifying chatter, no real element can develop in him, outside of what belongs to the world of mechanicity.

Certainly, whoever truly wants to achieve the development of the Essence within themselves must become hermetically sealed. This refers to something intimate, closely related to silence.

The phrase comes from ancient times, when a Doctrine on the inner development of man, linked to the name of Hermes, was secretly taught.

If one wants something real to grow inside, it is clear that one must avoid the escape of one's psychic energies.

When one has energy leaks and is not isolated in one's privacy, it is unquestionable that one will not be able to achieve the development of something real in one's psyche.

Ordinary, everyday life wants to devour us relentlessly; we must fight against life daily, we must learn to swim against the current...

This work goes against life; it is something very different from the everyday and yet we must practice it from moment to moment; I want to refer to the Revolution of Consciousness.

It is evident that if our attitude towards daily life is fundamentally wrong; if we believe that everything is going well for us, just because, disappointments will come...

People want things to go well for them, "just because", because everything should go according to their plans, but the harsh reality is different; as long as one does not change internally, whether one likes it or not, one will always be a victim of circumstances.

Many sentimental stupidities are said and written about life, but this Treatise on Revolutionary Psychology is different.

This Doctrine gets to the point, to concrete, clear and definitive facts; it emphatically states that the "Intellectual Animal" mistakenly called man is a mechanical, unconscious, sleeping biped.

"The Good Householder" would never accept Revolutionary Psychology; he fulfils all his duties as a father, husband, etc., and therefore thinks the best of himself, but only serves the purposes of nature and that is all.

In opposition, we will say that there is also "The Good Householder" who swims against the current, who does not want to be devoured by life; however, these subjects are very scarce in the world, they never abound.

When one thinks according to the ideas of this Treatise on Revolutionary Psychology, one obtains a correct vision of life.
