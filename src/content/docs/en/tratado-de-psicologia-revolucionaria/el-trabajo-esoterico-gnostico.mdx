It is urgent to study Gnosis and use the practical ideas we give in this work to work seriously on oneself.

However, we could not work on ourselves with the intention of dissolving such and such an "I" without having observed it previously.

Self-observation allows a ray of light to penetrate within us.

Any "I" expresses itself in the head in one way, in the heart in another way, and in sex in another way.

We need to observe the "I" that we find trapped at a given moment; it is urgent to see it in each of these three centres of our organism.

In relation to other people, if we are alert and vigilant like the watchman in time of war, we self-discover.

Do you remember what time your vanity was hurt? Your pride? What was the most upsetting thing of the day? Why did you have that upset? What is its secret cause? Study this, observe your head, heart and sex...

Practical life is a wonderful school; in inter-relation we can discover those "I's" that we carry within us.

Any upset, any incident, can lead us through intimate self-observation to the discovery of an "I", be it of self-love, envy, jealousy, anger, greed, suspicion, slander, lust, etc., etc., etc.

We need to know ourselves before we can know others. It is urgent to learn to see the other person's point of view.

If we put ourselves in the place of others, we discover that the psychological defects that we attribute to others, we have in abundance within us.

Loving one's neighbour is indispensable, but one cannot love others if one does not first learn to put oneself in the position of another person in esoteric work.

Cruelty will continue to exist on the face of the earth, as long as we have not learned to put ourselves in the place of others.

But if one does not have the courage to see oneself, how could one put oneself in the place of others?

Why should we see exclusively the bad side of other people?

The mechanical antipathy towards another person whom we meet for the first time indicates that we do not know how to put ourselves in the place of our neighbour, that we do not love our neighbour, that our consciousness is too asleep.

Do we find a certain person very unpleasant? For what reason? Perhaps they drink? Let's observe ourselves... Are we sure of our virtue? Are we sure that we do not carry within us the "I" of drunkenness?

It would be better if, when we see a drunkard clowning around, we said: "This is me, what clowning I am doing."

You are an honest and virtuous woman and that is why you dislike a certain lady; you feel antipathy for her. Why? Do you feel very sure of yourself? Do you believe that within you do not have the "I" of lust? Do you think that that lady discredited by her scandals and lasciviousness is perverse? Are you sure that within you there is no lasciviousness and perversity that you see in that woman?

It would be better if you intimately self-observed and that in deep meditation you took the place of that woman you abhor.

It is urgent to value the Gnostic esoteric work, it is indispensable to understand it and appreciate it if we really yearn for a radical change.

It becomes indispensable to know how to love our fellow human beings, to study Gnosis and to take this teaching to all people, otherwise we will fall into selfishness.

If one dedicates oneself to esoteric work on oneself, but does not give the teaching to others, one's intimate progress becomes very difficult due to lack of love for one's neighbour.

"He who gives, receives, and the more he gives, the more he will receive, but to him who gives nothing, even what he has will be taken away." That is the Law.
