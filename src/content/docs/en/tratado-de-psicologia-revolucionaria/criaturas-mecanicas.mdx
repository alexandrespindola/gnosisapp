In no way could we deny the Law of Recurrence processing at every moment of our life.

Certainly in each day of our existence, there is repetition of events, states of consciousness, word, desires, thoughts, volitions, etc.

It is obvious that when one does not self-observe, one cannot realise this incessant daily repetition.

It is evident that whoever has no interest in observing themselves, also does not want to work to achieve a true radical transformation.

To top it all off, there are people who want to transform themselves without working on themselves.

We do not deny the fact that everyone has the right to the real happiness of the spirit, but it is also true that happiness would be more than impossible if we do not work on ourselves.

One can change intimately, when one truly manages to modify their reactions to the various events that happen to them daily.

However, we could not modify our way of reacting to the events of practical life, if we did not work seriously on ourselves.

We need to change our way of thinking, be less negligent, become more serious and take life in a different way, in its real and practical sense.

However, if we continue as we are, behaving in the same way every day, repeating the same mistakes, with the same negligence as always, any possibility of change will in fact be eliminated.

If one truly wants to get to know oneself, one must start by observing one's own behaviour, in the face of the events of any day of life.

We do not mean by this that one should not observe oneself daily, we only want to affirm that one must start by observing a first day.

In everything there must be a beginning, and starting by observing our behaviour on any day of our life is a good beginning.

Observing our mechanical reactions to all those small details of the bedroom, home, dining room, house, street, work, etc., etc., etc., what one says, feels and thinks, is certainly the most indicated.

The important thing is to see then how or in what way one can change those reactions; however, if we believe that we are good people, that we never behave unconsciously and wrongly, we will never change.

First of all, we need to understand that we are person-machines, simple puppets controlled by secret agents, by hidden Selves.

Many people live within our person, we are never identical; sometimes a petty person manifests in us, other times an irritable person, at any other moment a splendid, benevolent person, later a scandalous or slanderous person, then a saint, then a liar, etc.

We have people of all kinds inside each of us, Selves of all kinds. Our personality is nothing more than a puppet, a talking doll, something mechanical.

Let's start by behaving consciously during a small part of the day; we need to stop being simple machines even for brief daily minutes, this will decisively influence our existence.

When we Self-Observe and do not do what such or such a Self wants, it is clear that we begin to stop being machines.

A single moment, in which one is conscious enough to stop being a machine, if done voluntarily, usually radically modifies many unpleasant circumstances.

Unfortunately, we live a mechanistic, routine, absurd life every day. We repeat events, our habits are the same, we have never wanted to modify them, they are the mechanical track through which the train of our miserable existence circulates, however, we think the best of ourselves...

Everywhere abound the "MYTHOMANIACS", those who believe themselves to be Gods; mechanical, routine creatures, characters from the mud of the earth, miserable dolls moved by various Selves; such people will not work on themselves...
