A person is what their life is. That which continues beyond death is life. This is the meaning of the book of life that opens with death.

Looking at this issue from a strictly psychological point of view, any given day of our life is really a small replica of the whole of life.

From all this we can infer the following: If a man does not work on himself today, he will never change.

When it is stated that one wants to work on oneself, and one does not work today postponing it for tomorrow, such a statement will be a simple project and nothing more, because in today is the replica of our whole life.

There is a vulgar saying that goes: "Never leave till tomorrow what may be done today."

If a man says: "I will work on myself tomorrow," he will never work on himself, because there will always be a tomorrow.

This is very similar to a certain notice, advertisement or sign that some merchants put in their shops: "NO CREDIT TODAY, TOMORROW YES".

When someone in need comes to ask for credit, they come across the terrible notice, and if they return the next day, they find the unfortunate announcement or sign again.

This is what is called in psychology the "disease of tomorrow". As long as a man says "tomorrow", he will never change.

We urgently need, with maximum and unpostponable urgency, to work on ourselves today, not to dream lazily of a future or an extraordinary opportunity.

Those who say: "I'm going to do this or that first and then I'll work." They will never work on themselves, those are the inhabitants of the earth mentioned in the Holy Scriptures.

I knew a powerful landowner who said: "I need to round myself out first and then work on Myself."

When he fell mortally ill, I visited him, then I asked him the following question: "Do you still want to round yourself out?"

"I truly regret wasting my time," he replied. Days later he died, after acknowledging his mistake.

That man had a lot of land, but he wanted to take over the neighboring properties, to "round himself out", so that his estate would be exactly bounded by four roads.

"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof!", said the Great KABIR JESUS. Let us self-observe ourselves today, regarding the ever-recurring day, a miniature of our entire life.

When a man begins to work on himself, today, when he observes his dislikes and sorrows, he walks the path of success.

It would not be possible to eliminate what we do not know. We must first observe our own mistakes.

We need not only to know our day, but also the relationship with it. There is a certain ordinary day that each person experiences directly, except for unusual, uncustomary events.

It is interesting to observe the daily recurrence, the repetition of words and events, for each person, etc.

That repetition or recurrence of events and words deserves to be studied, it leads us to self-knowledge.
