We have been very wisely told that we have ninety-seven per cent of SUBCONSCIOUSNESS and THREE PER CENT of CONSCIOUSNESS.

Frankly and without mincing words, we will say that ninety-seven per cent of the Essence that we carry within us is bottled up, packed, stuffed, inside each of the Selves that together constitute the "Me Myself".

Obviously, the Essence or Consciousness trapped between each Self is processed by virtue of its own conditioning.

Any disintegrated Self releases a certain percentage of Consciousness, the emancipation or liberation of the Essence or Consciousness would be impossible without the disintegration of each Self.

The greater the number of Selves disintegrated, the greater the Self-Consciousness. The fewer the number of Selves disintegrated, the lower the percentage of awakened Consciousness.

The awakening of Consciousness is only possible by dissolving the SELF, dying in oneself, here and now.

Unquestionably, while the Essence or Consciousness is stuffed between each of the Selves that we carry within us, it is asleep, in a subconscious state.

It is urgent to transform the subconscious into the conscious and this is only possible by annihilating the Selves; dying in themselves.

It is not possible to awaken without having previously died in oneself. Those who try to awaken first and then die, have no real experience of what they claim, they resolutely march down the path of error.

Newborn children are wonderful, they enjoy full self-consciousness; they are fully awake.

Within the body of the newborn child is reincorporated the Essence and that gives the creature its beauty.

We do not mean to say that one hundred per cent of the Essence or Consciousness is reincorporated in the newborn, but rather the three per cent free that is normally not trapped between the Selves.

However, that percentage of free Essence reincorporated among the organism of newborn children, gives them full self-consciousness, lucidity, etc.

Adults look at the newborn with pity, they think that the creature is unconscious, but they are unfortunately wrong.

The newborn sees the adult as he really is; unconscious, cruel, perverse, etc.

The Selves of the newborn come and go, they go around the crib, they would like to get between the new body, but because the newborn has not yet fabricated the personality, any attempt by the Selves to enter the new body is more than impossible.

Sometimes the creatures are frightened to see those ghosts or Selves that approach their crib and then they scream, cry, but the adults do not understand this and assume that the child is sick or that he is hungry or thirsty; such is the unconsciousness of the adults.

As the new personality is being formed, the Selves that come from previous existences are gradually penetrating the new body.

When the totality of the Selves has already been reincorporated, we appear in the world with that horrible inner ugliness that characterises us; then, we walk like sleepwalkers everywhere; always unconscious, always perverse.

When we die, three things go to the sepulchre: 1) The physical body. 2) The organic vital background. 3) The personality.

The vital background, like a ghost, is disintegrating little by little, in front of the sepulchral pit as the physical body is also disintegrating.

The personality is subconscious or infraconscious, it enters and leaves the sepulchre whenever it wants, it rejoices when the mourners bring it flowers, it loves its relatives and it is dissolving very slowly until it becomes cosmic dust.

That which continues beyond the sepulchre is the EGO, the pluralised SELF, the myself, a heap of devils within which is trapped the Essence, the Consciousness, which in its time and in its hour returns, is reincorporated.

It is regrettable that when the new personality of the child is fabricated, the Selves are also reincorporated.
