The world of relationships has three very different aspects that we need to clarify precisely.

First: We are related to the planetary body. That is to say, with the physical body.

Second: We live on planet Earth and, logically, we are related to the outside world and with the issues that concern us, family, business, money, matters of trade, profession, politics, etc., etc., etc.

Third: The relationship of man with himself. For most people, this type of relationship is of no importance whatsoever.

Unfortunately, people are only interested in the first two types of relationships, looking with the most absolute indifference at the third type.

Food, health, money, business, are really the main concerns of the "Intellectual Animal" mistakenly called "man".

Now then: It is evident that both the physical body and the affairs of the world are external to ourselves.

The Planetary Body (physical body) is sometimes sick, sometimes healthy and so on.

We always believe we have some knowledge of our physical body, but in reality even the best scientists in the world do not know much about the body of flesh and bone.

There is no doubt that the physical body, given its tremendous and complicated organisation, is certainly far beyond our comprehension.

With regard to the second type of relationships, we are always victims of circumstances; it is regrettable that we have not yet learned to consciously originate circumstances.

There are many people unable to adapt to anything or anyone or have true success in life.

When thinking about themselves from the angle of Gnostic esoteric work, it becomes urgent to find out which of these three types of relationships we are lacking in.

It may happen that we are wrongly related to the physical body and as a result we are sick.

It may happen that we are badly related to the outside world and as a result we have conflicts, economic and social problems, etc., etc., etc.

It may be that we are badly related to ourselves and that sequentially we suffer a lot from lack of inner illumination.

Obviously, if the lamp in our bedroom is not connected to the electrical installation, our room will be in darkness.

Those who suffer from lack of inner illumination should connect their mind with the Higher Centres of their Being.

Undoubtedly, we need to establish correct relationships not only with our Planetary Body (physical body) and with the outside world, but also with each of the parts of our own Being.

The pessimistic sick, tired of so many doctors and medicines, no longer want to be cured and the optimistic patients fight to live.

In the Monte Carlo Casino many millionaires who lost their fortune in gambling committed suicide. Millions of poor mothers work to support their children.

There are countless depressed aspirants who, due to lack of psychic powers and intimate illumination, have given up esoteric work on themselves. Few are those who know how to take advantage of adversity.

In times of rigorous temptation, dejection and desolation, one must appeal to the intimate remembrance of oneself.

In the depths of each of us is the Aztec TONANZIN, the STELLA MARIS, the Egyptian ISIS, God Mother, waiting for us to heal our aching heart.

When one gives oneself the shock of "Self-Remembrance", a miraculous change is really produced in all the work of the body, so that the cells receive a different food.
