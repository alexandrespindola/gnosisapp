Given that upper and lower are two sections of the same thing, it's worth stating the following corollary: "UPPER SELF, LOWER SELF" are two aspects of the same dark and pluralised Ego.

The so-called "DIVINE SELF" or "HIGHER SELF", "ALTER EGO" or something of the sort, is certainly a trick of the "SELF", a form of SELF-DECEPTION. When the SELF wants to continue here and in the hereafter, it deceives itself with the false concept of an Immortal Divine SELF...

None of us has a true, permanent, immutable, eternal, ineffable "Self", etc., etc., etc. None of us truly has a real and authentic Unity of Being; unfortunately we don't even possess a legitimate individuality.

The Ego, although it continues beyond the grave, nevertheless has a beginning and an end. The Ego, the SELF, is never something individual, unitary, unitotal. Obviously the SELF is "SELVES".

In Eastern Tibet, the "SELVES" are called "PSYCHIC AGGREGATES" or simply "Values", whether the latter are positive or negative. If we think of each "Self" as a different person, we can emphatically assert the following: "Within each person living in the world, there are many people".

Undeniably, within each of us live many different people, some better, others worse... Each of these Selves, each of these people fights for supremacy, wants to be exclusive, controls the intellectual brain or the emotional and motor centres whenever it can, while another displaces it...

The Doctrine of the many Selves was taught in Eastern Tibet by the true Clairvoyants, by the authentic Enlightened Ones... Each of our psychological defects is personified in such and such a Self. Since we have thousands and even millions of defects, ostensibly many people live inside us.

In psychological matters, we have been able to clearly demonstrate that paranoid, egomaniacal and mythomaniac subjects would never abandon the cult of the beloved Ego for anything. Undoubtedly, such people mortally hate the doctrine of the many "Selves".

When one truly wants to know oneself, one must self-observe and try to know the different "Selves" that are inside the personality. If any of our readers still do not understand this doctrine of the many "Selves", it is exclusively due to a lack of practice in matters of Self-Observation.

As one practices Inner Self-Observation, one discovers for oneself many people, many "Selves", who live within our own personality. Those who deny the doctrine of the many Selves, those who worship a Divine SELF, undoubtedly have never seriously Self-Observed. Speaking this time in a Socratic style, we will say that these people not only ignore but also ignore that they ignore.

Certainly we could never know ourselves without serious and profound self-observation. As long as any subject continues to consider himself as One, it is clear that any inner change will be more than impossible.
