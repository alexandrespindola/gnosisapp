This present Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology is a new Message that the Master grants to the brethren on the occasion of Christmas 1975. It is a complete Code that teaches us to kill defects.

Until now, the students have been content to repress defects, something like the military chief who imposes himself on his subordinates. We have personally been technicians in repressing defects, but the moment has come when we are forced to kill them, to eliminate them, making use of the technique of Master Samael, who in a clear, precise, and exact way gives us the keys.

When defects die, in addition to the Soul expressing itself with its immaculate beauty, everything changes for us. Many ask how to proceed when several defects arise at the same time, and to them we answer that they should eliminate some and let the others wait; these others can be repressed for later elimination.

In the FIRST CHAPTER; he teaches us how to turn the page of our lives, to break: anger, greed, envy, lust, pride, laziness, gluttony, desire, etc. It is essential to dominate the earthly mind and make the frontal vortex spin so that it absorbs the eternal knowledge of the Universal mind. In this same chapter, he teaches us to examine the moral level of Being and change this level. This is possible when we destroy our defects.

Every inner change brings about an outer change. The level of Being that the Master deals with in this work refers to the condition in which we find ourselves.

In the SECOND CHAPTER; he explains that the level of Being is the step where we are situated on the scale of Life. When we climb this scale, we progress, but when we remain stationary, it produces boredom, apathy, sadness, and grief.

In the THIRD CHAPTER; he speaks to us about Psychological Rebellion and teaches us that the Psychological starting point is within us, and he tells us that the vertical or perpendicular path is the field of the Rebels, of those who seek immediate changes, so that the work on oneself is the main characteristic of the vertical path; Humanoids walk on the horizontal path on the scale of life.

In the FOURTH CHAPTER; he determines how changes occur. The beauty of a child is due to the fact that they have not developed their defects, and we see that as these develop in the child, they lose their Innate beauty. When we disintegrate the defects, the Soul manifests itself in its splendor, and this is perceived by people at a simple glance, and the beauty of the Soul is what embellishes the physical body.

In the FIFTH CHAPTER; He teaches us the management of this Psychological gymnasium, and he teaches us the method to annihilate the secret ugliness that we carry inside (the defects); he teaches us to work on ourselves to achieve a Radical transformation.

Changing is necessary, but people do not know how to change, they suffer a lot and are content to blame others. They do not know that they are solely responsible for the management of their life.

In the SIXTH CHAPTER; he speaks to us about life, he tells us that life is a problem that no one understands: The states are Internal, and the events are External.

In the SEVENTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the Internal states, and he teaches us the difference that exists between the states of consciousness and the external events of practical life. When we modify the mistaken states of consciousness, this originates fundamental changes in us.

He speaks to us in the NINTH CHAPTER ABOUT PERSONAL EVENTS; and he teaches us to correct the mistaken Psychological states and the erroneous internal states, he teaches us to put order in our disordered inner house. The inner life brings external circumstances, and if these are painful, it is due to absurd inner states. The exterior is the reflection of the interior; the interior change immediately originates a new order of things.

The mistaken inner states turn us into defenseless victims of human perversity, he teaches us not to identify with any event, reminding us that everything passes; we must learn to see life as a movie, and in the drama we must be observers, not get confused with the drama.... One of my sons has a Theater where modern movies are exhibited, and it fills up when artists who have been distinguished with Oscars work there; One day my son Alvaro invited me to a movie where artists with Oscars worked, and I answered the invitation that I could not attend because I was Interested in a human drama better than that of his movie, where all the artists were Oscars; he asked me: What is that drama?, and I answered him, the drama of Life; He continued, but in that drama we all work, and I said to him: I work as an observer of that Drama. Why? I answered him: because I do not get confused with the drama, I do what I must do, I do not get excited or saddened by the events of the drama.

In the TENTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the different I's, and he explains to us that in the inner life of people there is no harmonious work because it is a sum of I's, that is why there are so many changes in the daily life of each of the actors in the drama: jealousy, laughter, tears, rage, fright, these characteristics show us the changes and alterations so varied to which the I's of our personality expose us.

In the ELEVENTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about our beloved Ego, and he tells us that the I's are psychic values, whether positive or negative, and he teaches us the practice of inner self-observation, and thus we discover many I's that live within our personality.

In the TWELFTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about Radical Change, there he teaches us that no change is possible in our psyche without direct observation of all that set of subjective factors that we carry inside.

When we learn that we are not one but many within us, we are on the path of self-knowledge. Knowledge and Understanding are different, the first is of the mind and the second is of the heart.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN; Observer and observed, there he speaks to us about the athlete of internal self-observation who is the one who works seriously on himself and strives to remove the undesirable elements that we carry inside.

For self-knowledge we must divide ourselves into observer and observed, without this division we could never reach self-knowledge.

In the FOURTEENTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about Negative thoughts; and we see that all the I's possess intelligence and use our Intellectual center to launch concepts, ideas, analyses, etc., which indicates that we do not possess an individual mind, we see in this chapter that the I's abusively use our thinking center.

In the FIFTEENTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about Individuality, there one realizes that we do not have consciousness or free will of our own, nor individuality. Through intimate self-observation we can see the people who live in our psyche (the I's) and that we must eliminate to achieve the Radical Transformation, since individuality is sacred, we see the case of the school teachers who spend their lives correcting children and thus reach decrepitude because they also got confused with the drama of life.

The remaining chapters from 16 to 32 are very interesting for all those people who want to get out of the crowd, for those who aspire to be something in life, for the haughty eagles, for the revolutionaries of consciousness and of indomitable spirit, for those who renounce the rubber spine, who bend their neck before the whip of any tyrant.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN; the Master speaks to us about the book of life, it is convenient to observe the repetition of daily words, the recurrence of the things of the same day, all this leads us to high knowledge.

In the SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about mechanical creatures, and he tells us that when one does not self-observe, one cannot realize the incessant daily repetition. Whoever does not wish to observe himself also does not wish to work to achieve a true Radical transformation; our personality is only a puppet, a talking doll, something mechanical, we are repeaters of events, our habits are the same, we have never wanted to modify them.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN; deals with the Super-Substantial Bread, habits... keep us petrified, we are mechanical people loaded with old habits, we must provoke internal changes. Self-observation is indispensable.

CHAPTER NINETEEN; he speaks to us about the good homeowner, we must isolate ourselves from the drama of life, we must defend the escape of the psyche, this work goes against life, it is about something very different from that of daily life.

While one does not change internally, one will always be a victim of circumstances. The good homeowner is the one who swims against the current, those who do not want to be devoured by life are very few.

In the TWENTIETH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the two worlds, and he tells us that the true knowledge that can really originate in us a fundamental inner change, has as its basis the direct self-observation of oneself. Inner self-observation is a means to change intimately, through self-observation, we learn to walk on the inner path, the sense of self-observation of oneself is atrophied in the human race, but this sense develops when we persevere in the self-observation of oneself, just as we learn to walk in the external world, so also through psychological work on oneself we learn to walk in the inner world.

In the TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER; he speaks to us about the observation of oneself, he tells us that the observation of oneself is a practical method to achieve a radical transformation, knowing is never observing, one must not confuse knowing with observing.

The observation of oneself is one hundred percent active, it is a means of change of oneself, while knowing, which is passive, is not. Dynamic attention comes from the observing side, while thoughts and emotions belong to the observed side. Knowing is something completely mechanical, passive; on the other hand, the observation of oneself is a conscious act.

In the TWENTY-SECOND CHAPTER; he speaks to us about the Talk, and he tells us that we should verify, that is, that "talking to oneself" is harmful, because they are our I's confronting each other. When you discover yourself talking to yourself, observe yourself and you will discover the nonsense you are committing.

In the TWENTY-THIRD CHAPTER; he speaks to us about the world of relationships, and he tells us that there are three states of relationships: obligatory with our own body, with the external world, and the relationship of man with himself, which is not important for most people, people are only interested in the first two types of relationships. We must study to know which of these three types we are at fault with.

The lack of inner elimination makes us not related to ourselves, and this makes us remain in darkness. When you find yourself dejected, disoriented, confused, remember "yourself", and this will make the cells of your body receive a different breath.

In the TWENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the psychological song, he tells us about the nagging, the self-defense, the feeling persecuted, etc., believing that others are to blame for everything that happens to us, while we take the triumphs as our own work, so we can never improve ourselves. The man bottled up in the concepts that he generates can become useful or useless, this is not the tone to observe ourselves and improve ourselves, learning to forgive is indispensable for our inner improvement. The law of Mercy is higher than the law of the violent man. "Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth." Gnosis is destined for those sincere aspirants who truly want to work and change, each one sings their own psychological song.

The sad memory of the things lived ties us to the past and does not allow us to live the present, which disfigures us. To move to a higher level, it is essential to stop being what one is; above each of us there are higher levels that we must climb.

In the TWENTY-FIFTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about Return and Recurrence, and he tells us that Gnosis is transformation, renovation, incessant improvement; the one who does not want to improve himself, transform himself, wastes his time because besides not advancing he remains on the path of regression and therefore becomes incapacitated to know himself; with just reason the V.M. asserts that we are puppets repeating the... scenes of life. When we reflect on these facts, we realize that we are artists who work for free in the drama of daily life.

When we have the power to watch ourselves to observe what our physical body does and executes, we place ourselves on the path of conscious self-observation and we observe that one thing is the consciousness, the one that knows, and another thing is the one that executes and obeys, that is, our own body. The comedy of life is hard and cruel with the one who does not know how to light the internal fires, he consumes himself within his own labyrinth in the midst of the deepest darkness, our I's live pleasantly in the darkness.

In the TWENTY-SIXTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the Childish Self-Consciousness, he says that when the child is born the Essence is reincorporated, this gives the child beauty, then as the personality develops, the I's that come from past lives are reincorporated and it loses its natural beauty.

In the TWENTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER; It deals with the Publican and the Pharisee, it says that each one rests on something that he has, hence the eagerness of everyone to have something: Titles, goods, money, fame, social position, etc. The man and woman inflated with pride are the ones who need the needy the most to live. Man rests only on external bases; he is also an invalid because the day he loses those bases he will become the most unhappy man in the world.

When we feel greater than others, we are fattening our I's and thereby refuse to be blessed. For esoteric work, our own praises are obstacles that oppose all spiritual progress. When we self-observe, we can cover the bases on which we rest. We must pay close attention to the things that offend or lacerate us; thus we discover the psychological bases on which we find ourselves.

On this path of improvement, the one who believes himself superior to another stagnates or regresses. In the Initiatic process of my life, a great change occurred when, afflicted by thousands of asperities, disappointments and misfortunes, I took the course of "pariah" in my home. I abandoned the pose of "I am the giver of everything for this home" to feel like a sad beggar, sick and with nothing in life; everything changed in my life because I was given: breakfast, lunch and dinner, clean clothes and the right to sleep in the same bed as my patron (the Priestess wife), but this only lasted days because that home could not bear that attitude or war tactic. We must learn to transform evil into good, darkness into light, hatred into love, etc.

The Real Being does not discuss or understand the insults of the I's that our adversaries or friends fire at us. Those who feel those lashes are the I's that bind our soul, they get involved and react choleric and irate, they are interested in going against the Internal Christ, against our own seed.

When students ask us for a remedy to cure pollutions, we advise them to abandon anger; those who have done so obtain benefits.

In the TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER; The Master speaks to us about the Will, he tells us that we must work in this work of the Father, but the students believe that it is to work with the arcanum A.Z.F., the work on ourselves, the work with the three factors that liberate our consciousness, we must conquer ourselves Internally, liberate the Prometheus that we have chained within us.

The Creative will is our work, whatever the circumstance in which we find ourselves.
The emancipation of the Will comes with the elimination of our defects, and nature obeys us.

In the TWENTY-NINTH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about Decapitation, he tells us that the most peaceful moments of our lives are the least favorable for self-knowledge; this is only achieved in the work of life, in social relations, business, games, in short, in daily life is when our... I's yearn the most. The sense of internal self-observation is atrophied in every human being; this sense develops progressively with the self-observation that we execute, from moment to moment and with continuous use.

Everything that is out of place is bad, and the bad ceases to be so when it is in its place, when it should be.

With the power of the Mother Goddess in us, the Mother RAM-IO we can only destroy the I's of the different levels of the mind; the formula will be found by the readers in several works of the V.M. Samael.

Stella Maris is the astral subject, the sexual potency, she has the power to disintegrate the aberrations that we carry in our psychological interior.
"Tonazin" decapitates any psychological I.

In the THIRTIETH CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the Permanent Center of Gravity, and he tells us that each person is a service machine for the innumerable I's that possess him, and consequently the human person does not possess a permanent center of gravity. Therefore, there is only instability to achieve the intimate self-realization of the Being; continuity of purpose is required, and this is achieved by extirpating the egos or I's that we carry inside.

If we do not work on ourselves, we involute and degenerate. The process of Initiation puts us on the path of overcoming, it leads us to the Angelic-Devic state.

In the THIRTY-FIRST CHAPTER; He speaks to us about the low Gnostic Esotericism, and he tells us that it is required to examine the trapped I or that we recognize it. An indispensable requirement to be able to destroy it is observation; this allows a ray of light to enter our interior.

The destruction of the I's that we have analyzed must be accompanied by services to others, giving them instruction so that they can free themselves from the satans or I's that obstruct their own redemption.

In the THIRTY-SECOND CHAPTER; He speaks to us about Prayer in Work, he tells us that Observation, Judgment and Execution are the three basic factors of the dissolution of the Self. 1st - one observes, 2nd - one judges, 3rd - one executes; this is how it is done with spies in war. The sense of internal self-observation, as it develops, will allow us to see the progressive advance of our work.

25 years ago on Christmas 1951, the Master told us here in the city of Ciénaga, and later he explains it in the Christmas Message of 1962, the following:
"I am on your side until you have formed the Christ in your Heart."

On his shoulders rests the responsibility of the people of Aquarius, and the doctrine of Love expands through Gnostic knowledge. If you want to follow the doctrine of Love, you must stop hating, even in its most minute manifestation. This prepares us for the emergence of the golden child, the child of alchemy, the son of chastity, the Internal Christ who lives and throbs in the very depths of our Creative Energy. Thus, we achieve the death of the legions of Satanic I's that we keep inside, and we prepare ourselves for the resurrection, for a total change.

This Holy Doctrine is not understood by the humans of this Era, but we must fight for them in the cult of all religions, so that they yearn for a superior life, directed by superior beings. This body of doctrine returns us to the doctrine of the Internal Christ. When we put it into practice, we will change the future of humanity.

INVERENTIAL PEACE,
GARGHA KUICHINES
