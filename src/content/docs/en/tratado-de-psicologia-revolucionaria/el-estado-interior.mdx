To correctly combine inner states with outer events is to know how to live intelligently... Any intelligently experienced event demands its corresponding specific inner state...

However, unfortunately, when people review their lives, they think that life itself is made up exclusively of external events... Poor people! They think that if such and such an event had not happened to them, their life would have been better...

They assume that luck passed them by and that they lost the opportunity to be happy... They lament what was lost, mourn what they despised, groan remembering old stumbles and calamities...

People do not want to realise that vegetating is not living and that the capacity to exist consciously depends exclusively on the quality of the inner states of the Soul... It certainly does not matter how beautiful the external events of life are, if we are not in the appropriate inner state at such times, the best events can seem monotonous, tiresome or simply boring...

Someone anxiously awaits the wedding party, it is an event, but it could happen that they are so worried at the precise moment of the event, that they really do not enjoy any delight in it and that everything becomes as arid and cold as a protocol...

Experience has taught us that not all people who attend a banquet or a dance truly enjoy themselves... There is always someone bored at the best of festivities and the most delicious pieces cheer some and make others cry...

Very rare are the people who know how to confidentially combine the external event with the appropriate internal state... It is unfortunate that people do not know how to live consciously: they cry when they should laugh and laugh when they should cry...

Control is different: The wise person can be cheerful but never full of mad frenzy; sad but never desperate and dejected... serene in the midst of violence; abstemious in the orgy; chaste among lust, etc.

Melancholic and pessimistic people think the worst of life and frankly do not want to live... Every day we see people who are not only unhappy, but also — and what is worse — make the lives of others bitter as well...

Such people would not change even living daily from party to party; the psychological illness they carry within... such people possess intimately perverse states...

However, those subjects self-qualify as righteous, saintly, virtuous, noble, helpful, martyrs, etc., etc., etc. They are people who think too much of themselves; people who love themselves very much...

Individuals who pity themselves a lot and who are always looking for ways to evade their own responsibilities... Such people are accustomed to inferior emotions and it is ostensible that for that reason they daily create subhuman psychic elements.

Unfortunate events, reverses of fortune, misery, debts, problems, etc., are exclusive to those people who do not know how to live... Anyone can form a rich intellectual culture, but very few people have learned to live rightly...

When one wants to separate external events from the inner states of consciousness, one concretely demonstrates one's inability to exist with dignity. Those who learn to consciously combine external events and inner states, march on the path to success...
