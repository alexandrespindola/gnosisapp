It is impossible to have continuity of purpose without a true individuality.

Therefore, if the psychological individual does not exist, if many persons live within each one of us, if there is no responsible person within, it would be an absurdity to demand continuity of purpose from someone.

We know well that many persons live within a person. Hence, the full sense of responsibility does not really exist in us.

We cannot take seriously what any particular “I” affirms at any given moment because of the concrete fact that any other “I” can affirm exactly the opposite at any other moment.

What is critical of all this subject matter is that many people believe that they possess a sense of moral responsibility, yet they deceive themselves when affirming that they are always the same.

People exist who at some moment of their existence come to the Gnostic studies: they glow through the force of their enthusiasm; they become devoted to the esoteric work and even swear to consecrate the whole of their existence to these matters.

Unquestionably, all the brethren of our movement even admire such an enthusiastic one.

One cannot but feel great happiness in listening to these kinds of people, so devoted and definitely sincere.

However, the idyll does not last very long. Any given day, due to this or that reason, just or unjust, simple or complex, the person withdraws from Gnosis and abandons the work. Thus, in order to right the wrong, or in trying to justify himself, he joins any other mystical organization and thinks that he is then doing better.

All this coming and going, all this incessant change of schools, sects, religions, is due to the multiplicity of “I’s” that struggle amongst themselves for their own supremacy within our interior.

This constant fluttering around among organizations, from idea to idea, this change of opinions is but normal, since every “I” possesses its own criteria, its own mind, its own ideas.

Therefore, such a person in himself is nothing more than a machine who just easily serves as a vehicle to one “I” or another.

Some mystical “I’s” deceive themselves after having aband-oned this sect or the other. They decide to believe themselves to be Gods. Thus, they shine like fatuous lights and finally disappear.

There exist people who show themselves for a moment to the esoteric work, then, all of a sudden, another “I” intervenes. Thus, they definitely abandon these studies and allow themselves to be swallowed by life.

Obviously, if one does not struggle against life, then one is devoured by life. Very rare are the aspirants who truly do not allow themselves to be swallowed up by life.

The permanent center of gravity cannot exist within us as long as a whole multiplicity of “I’s” exist inside of us.

It is normal that not all people achieve the realization of the Innermost Self.

We know very well that the realization of the Innermost Being demands continuity of purpose. Therefore, it is not strange that only very few people can attain the profound inner Self-realization, since it is very difficult to find someone with a permanent center of gravity.

What is normal in this subject matter is for someone to become enthusiastic for the esoteric work and then to abandon it. What is strange is for someone to not abandon the work and to reach the goal.

Indeed, in the name of the truth, we affirm that the Sun is conducting a very complex and terribly difficult laboratory experiment.

Germs (seeds) exist within the intellectual animal (mistakenly called the human being) that when conveniently developed can convert us into Solar Humans.

Nonetheless, it is not irrelevant to clarify that the development of these germs cannot be taken for granted. What is normal is for these germs to degenerate and become lamentably lost.

In any event, the above-mentioned germs which can convert us into Solar Humans need an adequate environment. It is well known that the seed in a sterile environment does not germinate; it is lost.

Continuity of purpose and a normal physical body are necessary in order for the real seed of the Human Being, deposited in our sexual glands, to be able to germinate.

Yet, if the scientists continue experimenting with the glands of internal secretion, then any possibility of develop-ment for these aforementioned germs can be lost.

Although it may seem incredible, the ants already passed through a similar process, in a remote, archaic past of our planet Earth.

One is filled with wonder when contemplating the perfection of the nests of ants. There is no doubt that the order established in any ants’ nest is overwhelming.

The Initiates who have awakened their consciousness know through direct mystical experience that in ages which the most famous historians of the world do not even remotely suspect, the ants were a human race who created a very powerful socialist civilization.

At that time, the dictators of such a race eliminated the diverse religious sects and free will, for all of these things undermined power away from them. They needed to be totalitarians in the most complete sense of the word.

So, in these conditions, after having eliminated individual initiative and religious rights, these intellectual animals precipitated themselves downwards into the path of devolution and degeneration.

Moreover, they added to the aforementioned scientific experiments: transplant of organs, glands, hormonal tests, etc., whose outcome was the gradual diminishing in size and the morphological alteration of their human organisms until finally, through the ages, they became the ants that we know now.

Thus, their entire civilization, all those movements related with their established social order, became mechanical and were inherited from parents to children. Today, one is astonished when seeing an ants’ nest, yet we cannot but lament its lack of intelligence.

Therefore, if we do not work on ourselves, we devolve and degenerate horribly.

Indeed, the experiment that the Sun is conducting in the laboratory of Nature, besides being difficult, has given very few positive results.

The creation of Solar Humans is only possible when true cooperation exists within each one of us.

Thus, if first of all we do not establish a permanent center of gravity within our interior, then the creation of the Solar Human Being is impossible.

How can we have continuity of purpose if we do not establish a center of gravity in our psyche?

Certainly, any race created by the Sun has no other objective in Nature but to serve the interests of this creation and the Solar experiment.

Yet, if the Sun fails in its experiment, then it loses all interest in such a race. Thus, such a race is left condemned to destruction and devolution.

Each of the root races that have existed on the face of the Earth served the Solar experiment. From each root race, the Sun has managed to get a few to fruition, that is to say the Sun has harvested small groups of Solar Humans.

After a root race has given its fruits, it disappears in a progressive manner, or perishes violently due to great catastrophes.

The creation of Solar Humans is possible when one struggles to become independent from the lunar forces. There is no doubt that all those “I’s” that we carry within our psyche are exclusively of a lunar type.

By no means is it possible to liberate ourselves from the lunar force if we do not previously establish within ourselves a Permanent Center of Gravity.

How can we dissolve the total of the pluralized “I” if we do not have a continuity of purpose? In what way can we have continuity of purpose without previously having established within our psyche a Permanent Center of Gravity?

Hence, this contemporary race has condemned itself towards devolution and degeneration, since instead of becoming independent of the lunar influence it has unquestionably lost all interest for the Solar Intelligence.

It is not possible for the true Human Being to appear through the mechanics of evolution. We know very well that evolution and its twin sister devolution are nothing else but two laws which constitute the mechanical axis of all Nature. One evolves to a certain perfectly defined point, and then the devolving process follows. Every ascent is followed by a descent and vice-versa.

We are machines that are controlled exclusively by different “I’s.” We serve Nature’s economy. We do not have a defined individuality as is erroneously supposed by many pseudo-esotericists and pseudo-occultists.

We need to change with maximum urgency so that the germs of the Human Being will give its fruits.

We can become Solar Humans only by working on ourselves with true continuity of purpose and a complete sense of moral responsibility. This implies the total consecration of our existence to the esoteric work on ourselves.

Those who hope to reach the Solar State through the mechanics of evolution fool themselves and condemn themselves, in fact, to a devolving degeneration.

In the esoteric work, we cannot afford the luxury of versatility. Those who have fickle ideas, those who work on their psyche today and let themselves be swallowed by life tomorrow, those who seek subterfuges and justifications in order to abandon the esoteric work will degenerate and devolve.

Some postpone the error, leave everything for tomorrow while they improve their economic situation, without taking into consideration that the Solar experiment is something very different from their personal criteria and their aforementioned projects.

It is not so easy to become a Solar Human when we carry the Moon in our interior (the ego is lunar).

The Earth has two moons. The second one is named Lilith and is a little farther away than the white moon.

Astronomers often see Lilith like a lentil, since it is very small in size. It is the black moon.

The most disastrous forces of the ego come to the Earth from Lilith and produce infrahuman and bestial psychological results.

The crimes mentioned in the news, the most monstrous murders in history, the most unsuspected crimes, etc. are due to the vibratory waves of Lilith.

These two lunar influences are represented within the human being through the ego that we carry in our interior and which makes of us true failures.

Therefore, if we do not see the urgency of surrendering our total existence to the work on ourselves with the purpose of liberating ourselves from the double lunar force, then we shall end up swallowed up by the Moon, devolving, degenerating more and more into certain states which we could very well classify as unconscious and infraconscious.

The sad part of all this is that we do not possess true individuality. If we had a permanent center of gravity we would then truly work seriously in order to achieve the Solar State.

There are so many excuses in these matters, so many evasions, so many fascinating attractions, that it usually becomes almost impossible to comprehend the urgency of the esoteric work.

Nevertheless, the small amount that we have of free will and the Gnostic teaching oriented towards practical work can serve as a basis for our noble intentions in relation to the Solar experiment.

What we are stating here is not understandable by the fickle mind. The fickle mind reads this chapter and then forgets it; it reads another book, then another. To that end, our fickle mind tends to end up joining any institution which sells us a passport to heaven, that talks to us in a more optimistic manner, that assures us of comforts in the beyond.

This is how people are mere marionettes controlled by invisible strings, mechanical dolls with fickle ideas and without continuity of purpose.
