It's urgently, immediately, and imperatively necessary to observe the inner dialogue and the precise place from which it originates.

Undeniably, the wrong inner dialogue is the "Causa Causorum" of many disharmonious and unpleasant psychic states in the present and also in the future.

Obviously, that vain, insubstantial babble of ambiguous talk, and in general all harmful, damaging, absurd conversation manifested in the external world, has its origin in the wrong inner conversation.

It is known that in Gnosis there is the esoteric practice of inner silence; this is known to our "Third Chamber" disciples.

It doesn't hurt to say with complete clarity that inner silence must specifically refer to something very precise and defined.

When the process of thinking is intentionally exhausted during deep inner meditation, inner silence is achieved; but this is not what we want to explain in the present chapter.

"Emptying the mind" or "putting it blank" to truly achieve inner silence, is also not what we are trying to explain now in these paragraphs.

Practicing the inner silence to which we are referring, also does not mean preventing something from penetrating the mind.

We are really talking right now about a very different type of inner silence. It's not about something vague or general...

We want to practice inner silence in relation to something that is already in the mind, a person, event, one's own or someone else's affair, what we were told, what so-and-so did, etc., but without touching it with the inner tongue, without intimate discourse...

Learning to be silent not only with the external tongue, but also, in addition, with the secret, internal tongue, is extraordinary, wonderful.

Many are outwardly silent, but with their inner tongue they flay their neighbour alive. Venomous and malevolent inner talk produces inner confusion.

If the wrong inner talk is observed, it will be seen that it is made of half-truths, or of truths that are related to each other in a more or less incorrect way, or something that was added or omitted.

Unfortunately, our emotional life is based exclusively on "self-sympathy".

To top off so much infamy, we only sympathise with ourselves, with our so "beloved Ego", and we feel antipathy and even hatred towards those who do not sympathise with us.

We love ourselves too much, we are narcissistic in a hundred percent, this is irrefutable, undeniable.

As long as we remain bottled up in "self-sympathy", any development of the Being becomes something more than impossible.

We need to learn to see the other person's point of view. It is urgent to know how to put ourselves in the position of others.

"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them". (Matthew: VII, 12)

What really counts in these studies is the way men behave internally and invisibly towards each other.

Unfortunately, and although we are very courteous, even sincere at times, there is no doubt that invisibly and internally we treat each other very badly.

Apparently very kind people, daily drag their fellow men into the secret cave of themselves, to do with them, everything they want. (Vexations, ridicule, scorn, etc.)
