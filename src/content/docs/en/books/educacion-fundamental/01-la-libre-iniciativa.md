Millions of students from all over the world go daily to School and University in an unconscious, automatic, subjective way, without knowing why or for what purpose.

Students are forced to study Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, etc.

The minds of students are receiving daily information but they never stop for a moment to think about the reason for that information, the purpose of that information.

Why do we fill ourselves with that information? What do we fill ourselves with that information for?

Students really live a mechanistic life and only know that they have to receive intellectual information and keep it stored in the unfaithful memory; that is all.
