In life, the only important thing is radical, total and definitive change; frankly, everything else is of no importance whatsoever.

Meditation is fundamental when we sincerely desire such change.

In no way do we desire inconsequential, superficial and futile meditation.

We need to get serious and put aside so much of the nonsense that abounds in cheap pseudo-esotericism and pseudo-occultism.

One must know how to be serious, one must know how to change if we really, truly do not want to fail in esoteric work.

He who does not know how to meditate, the superficial one, the ignorant one, will never be able to dissolve the Ego; he will always be an impotent log in the furious sea of life.

A flaw discovered in the realm of practical life must be deeply understood through the technique of meditation.

The didactic material for meditation is found precisely in the various daily events or circumstances of practical life, this is incontrovertible.

People always protest against unpleasant events, they never know how to see the usefulness of such events.

Instead of protesting against unpleasant circumstances, we should extract from them, through meditation, the useful elements for our soul growth.

Deep meditation on this or that pleasant or unpleasant circumstance allows us to feel in ourselves the taste, the result.

It is necessary to make a full psychological differentiation between what is the taste of work and the taste of life.

In any case, to feel in oneself the taste of work requires a total inversion of the attitude with which the circumstances of existence are normally taken.

No one could enjoy the taste of work as long as they make the mistake of identifying with the various events.

Certainly, identification prevents the proper psychological appreciation of events.

When one identifies with this or that event, in no way can one extract from it the useful elements for self-discovery and inner growth of consciousness.

The Esoteric worker who returns to identification after having lost guard, again feels the taste of life instead of the taste of work.

This indicates that the previously inverted psychological attitude has returned to its state of identification.

Any unpleasant circumstance must be reconstructed by means of conscious imagination through the technique of meditation.

The reconstruction of any scene allows us to verify for ourselves and directly the intervention of various participating egos in it.

Examples: A scene of amorous jealousy; in it intervene egos of anger, jealousy and even hatred.

Understanding each of these egos, each of these factors, in fact implies deep reflection, concentration, meditation.

The marked tendency to blame others is an obstacle to the understanding of our own mistakes.

Unfortunately, it is a very difficult task to destroy in ourselves the tendency to blame others.

In the name of truth, we must say that we are solely responsible for the various unpleasant circumstances of life.

The various pleasant or unpleasant events exist with us or without us and are mechanically repeated continuously.

Starting from this principle, no problem can have a final solution.

Problems are part of life and if there were a final solution, life would not be life but death.

So there can be modification of circumstances and problems, but they will never cease to repeat themselves and will never have a final solution.

Life is a wheel that turns mechanically with all pleasant and unpleasant circumstances, always recurring.

We cannot stop the wheel, good or bad circumstances are always processed mechanically, we can only change our attitude towards the events of life.

As we learn to extract the material for meditation from the very circumstances of existence, we will self-discover ourselves.

In any pleasant or unpleasant circumstance there are various egos that must be fully understood with the technique of meditation.

This means that any group of egos intervening in this or that drama, comedy or tragedy of practical life, after having been fully understood, must be eliminated by the power of the Divine Mother Kundalini.

As we make use of the sense of psychological observation, the latter will also develop wonderfully. Then we will be able to perceive internally not only the egos before they have been worked on, but also during all the work.

When these egos are beheaded and disintegrated, we feel great relief, great bliss.
