A man is what his life is: if a man does not work his own life, he is wasting his time miserably.

Only by eliminating the undesirable elements that we carry within us can we make our life a masterpiece.

Death is the return to the beginning of life, with the possibility of repeating it again on the stage of a new existence.

The various pseudo-esoteric and pseudo-occult schools hold the eternal theory of successive lives; such a concept is wrong.

Life is a film; once the screening is finished, we roll the tape onto its reel and take it with us for eternity.

Re-entry exists, return exists; when we return to this world we project the same film, the same life, onto the carpet of existence.

We can establish the thesis of successive existences; but not of successive lives because the film is the same.

The human being has three per cent of free essence and ninety-seven per cent of essence bottled up between the egos.

Upon returning, the three per cent of free essence completely impregnates the fertilised egg; unquestionably we continue in the seed of our descendants.

Personality is different; there is no tomorrow for the personality of the dead; the latter slowly dissolves in the pantheon or cemetery.

In the newborn, only the small percentage of free essence has been reincorporated; this gives the creature self-awareness and inner beauty.

The various egos that return circle around the newborn, they come and go freely everywhere, they would like to get inside the organic machine but this is not possible until a new personality has been created.

It is important to know that personality is energetic and that it is formed with experience over time.

It is written that personality must be created during the first seven years of childhood and that it is subsequently strengthened and fortified with practice.

The egos begin to intervene within the organic machine little by little as the new personality is created.

Death is a subtraction of fractions, once the mathematical operation is finished, the only thing that continues are the values (that is, the good and bad egos, useful and useless, positive and negative).

The values in the astral light attract and repel each other according to the laws of universal magnetisation.

We are mathematical points in space that serve as vehicles for certain sums of values.

Within the human personality of each of us there are always these values that serve as the basis for the law of Recurrence.

Everything happens again just as it happened but the result or consequence of our previous actions.

Since within each of us there are many egos from previous lives, we can emphatically affirm that each of those is a different person.

This invites us to understand that within each of us live many people with different commitments.

Within the personality of a thief there is a true den of thieves; within the personality of a murderer there is an entire club of assassins; within the personality of a lustful person there is a brothel; within the personality of any prostitute there is an entire brothel.

Each of those people that we carry within our own personality has their problems and their commitments.

People living inside people, persons living inside persons; this is irrefutable, unanswerable.

The serious thing about all this is that each of those people or egos that lives within us comes from ancient existences and has certain commitments.

The ego that in the past existence had a love affair at the age of thirty, in the new existence will wait for such age to manifest and when the time comes will look for the person of his dreams, will get in telepathic contact with her and finally there will be the reunion and the repetition of the scene.

The ego that at the age of forty had a dispute over material goods, in the new existence will wait for such age to repeat the same gossip.

The ego that at the age of twenty-five fought with another man in the cantina or bar, will wait in the new existence for the new age of twenty-five to look for his adversary and repeat the tragedy.

The egos of one and another subject look for each other through telepathic waves and then they meet again to mechanically repeat the same thing.

This is really the mechanics of the Law of Recurrence, this is the tragedy of life.

Through thousands of years the various characters meet again to relive the same dramas, comedies and tragedies.

The human person is nothing more than a machine at the service of these egos with so many commitments.

The worst thing about all this is that all these commitments of the people we carry inside us are fulfilled without our understanding having any prior information.

Our human personality in this sense seems like a cart pulled by multiple horses.

There are lives of exact repetition, recurrent existences that never change.

In no way could the comedies, dramas and tragedies of life be repeated on the screen of existence, if there were no actors.

The actors of all these scenes are the egos that we carry inside us and that come from ancient existences.

If we disintegrate the egos of anger, the tragic scenes of violence inevitably conclude.

If we reduce the secret agents of greed to cosmic dust, the problems of greed will end completely.

If we annihilate the egos of lust, the scenes of the brothel and morbidity end.

If we reduce the secret characters of envy to ashes, the events of envy will end radically.

If we kill the egos of pride, vanity, conceit, self-importance, the ridiculous scenes of these defects will end due to lack of actors.

If we eliminate from our psyche the factors of laziness, inertia and idleness, the horrifying scenes of this kind of defect will not be able to be repeated due to lack of actors.

If we pulverise the disgusting egos of gluttony, the banquets, the drunkneness, etc. will end due to lack of actors.

Since these multiple egos are processed unfortunately in the different levels of the being, it is necessary to know their causes, their origin and the Christic procedures that will finally lead us to the death of the self and to the final liberation.

Studying the intimate Christ, studying Christic esotericism is basic when it comes to provoking a radical and definitive change in us; this is what we will study in upcoming chapters.
