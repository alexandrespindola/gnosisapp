In the realm of practical life, each person has their own criteria, their somewhat stale way of thinking, and never opens themselves up to the new; this is irrefutable, unanswerable, incontrovertible.

The mind of the intellectual humanoid is degenerated, deteriorated, in a clear state of involution.

Truly, the understanding of current humanity is similar to an old, inert, and absurd mechanical structure, incapable in itself of any phenomenon of authentic elasticity.

There is a lack of pliability in the mind; it is trapped in multiple rigid and outdated norms.

Each person has their own criteria and certain rigid norms within which they act and react incessantly.

The most serious part of this whole issue is that the millions of criteria are equivalent to millions of rotten and absurd norms.

In any case, people never feel wrong; each head is a world, and there is no doubt that among so many mental nooks and crannies, there are many sophisms of distraction and unbearable stupidities.

But the narrow-mindedness of the multitudes does not even remotely suspect the intellective bottleneck in which they find themselves.

These modern people with cockroach brains think the best of themselves, presume to be liberal, super-geniuses, and believe that they have a very broad outlook.

The enlightened ignoramuses turn out to be the most difficult because, in reality, speaking this time in a Socratic sense, we will say: "not only do they not know, but also, they are unaware that they do not know".

The rogues of the intellect, clinging to those outdated norms of the past, process themselves violently by virtue of their own bottlenecking and emphatically refuse to accept anything that cannot in any way fit within their steel norms.

The enlightened know-it-alls think that anything that for one reason or another deviates from the rigid path of their rusty procedures is one hundred per cent absurd. In this way, these poor people of such difficult criteria miserably self-deceive.

The pseudo-wise of this era presume to be geniuses, look with disdain at those who have the courage to deviate from their time-worn norms, and the worst thing of all is that they do not even remotely suspect the harsh reality of their own clumsiness.

The intellectual pettiness of stale minds is such that it even indulges in demanding demonstrations about that which is real, about that which is not of the mind.

The people of stunted and intolerant understanding do not want to understand that the experience of the real only comes in the absence of the ego.

Unquestionably, in no way would it be possible to directly recognise the mysteries of life and death until the inner mind has opened within ourselves.

It is worth repeating in this chapter that only the superlative consciousness of Being can know the truth.

The inner mind can only function with the data provided by the Cosmic consciousness of the SELF.

The subjective intellect, with its reasoning dialectic, can know nothing about that which escapes its jurisdiction.

We already know that the concepts of content of the reasoning dialectic are elaborated with the data provided by the senses of external perception.

Those who are bottled up within their intellectual procedures and fixed norms always present resistance to these revolutionary ideas.

Only by dissolving the EGO in a radical and definitive way is it possible to awaken consciousness and truly open the inner mind.

However, since these revolutionary declarations do not fit within formal logic, nor within dialectical logic, the subjective reaction of the involutionary minds offers violent resistance.

These poor people of the intellect want to put the ocean inside a glass, suppose that the university can control all the wisdom of the universe and that all the laws of the Cosmos are obliged to submit to their old academic norms.

Those simpletons, paragons of wisdom, do not even remotely suspect the degenerative state in which they find themselves.

Sometimes such people stand out for a moment when they come to the Esoteric world, but soon they go out like will-o'-the-wisps, disappear from the panorama of spiritual concerns, are swallowed up by the intellect, and disappear from the scene forever.

The superficiality of the intellect can never penetrate into the legitimate depths of the SELF, but the subjective processes of rationalism can lead fools to all kinds of very brilliant but absurd conclusions.

The power to formulate logical concepts in no way implies the experience of the real.

The convincing game of reasoning dialectics self-fascinates the reasoner, making them always confuse chalk with cheese.

The brilliant procession of ideas obfuscates the rogue of the intellect and gives them a certain self-sufficiency so absurd as to reject everything that does not smell of library dust and university ink.

The "delirium tremens" of alcoholic drunks has unmistakable symptoms, but that of those drunk on theories is easily confused with genius.

Arriving at this part of our chapter, we will say that it is certainly very difficult to know where the intellectualism of the rogues ends and where madness begins.

As long as we continue bottled up within the rotten and stale norms of the intellect, the experience of that which is not of the mind, of that which is not of time, of that which is real, will be more than impossible.
