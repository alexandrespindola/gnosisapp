In esoteric work related to eliminating the undesirable elements we carry within, annoyance, tiredness and boredom sometimes arise.

Undoubtedly, we always need to return to the original starting point and re-evaluate the foundations of psychological work, if we truly yearn for radical change.

Loving esoteric work is essential when a complete inner transformation is truly desired.

As long as we do not love the psychological work leading to change, the re-evaluation of principles is more than impossible.

It would be absurd to assume that we could be interested in the work if we have not truly come to love it.

This means that love is essential when we repeatedly try to re-evaluate the foundations of psychological work.

It is urgent, first of all, to know what is called consciousness, because there are many people who have never been interested in knowing anything about it.

Any ordinary person would never ignore that a boxer, when knocked out in the ring, loses consciousness.

It is clear that upon regaining consciousness, the unfortunate pugilist acquires it again.

Sequentially, anyone understands that there is a clear difference between personality and consciousness.

When we come into the world, we all have three per cent of consciousness in existence and ninety-seven per cent divided between the subconscious, infraconsciousness and unconsciousness.

The three per cent of awakened consciousness can be increased as we work on ourselves.

It is not possible to increase consciousness through exclusively physical or mechanical procedures.

Undoubtedly, consciousness can only awaken based on conscious work and voluntary suffering.

There are several types of energy within ourselves that we must understand: First - mechanical energy. Second - vital energy. Third - psychic energy. Fourth - mental energy. Fifth - energy of will. Sixth - energy of consciousness. Seventh - energy of the pure spirit. No matter how much we multiply strictly mechanical energy, we will never awaken consciousness.

No matter how much we increase the vital forces within our organism, we will never awaken consciousness.

Many psychological processes take place within themselves, without consciousness intervening in any way.

No matter how great the disciplines of the mind are, mental energy will never awaken the various functionalisms of consciousness.

The force of will, even if multiplied to infinity, does not awaken consciousness.

All these types of energy are staggered at different levels and dimensions that have nothing to do with consciousness.

Consciousness can only be awakened through conscious work and righteous efforts.

The small percentage of consciousness that humanity possesses, instead of being increased, is usually wasted uselessly in life.

It is obvious that by identifying with all the events of our existence, we uselessly squander the energy of consciousness.

We should see life as a film without ever identifying with any comedy, drama or tragedy, thus saving conscious energy.

Consciousness in itself is a type of energy with a very high vibratory frequency.

Consciousness should not be confused with memory, as they are as different from each other as the light from the car's headlights is to the road we are driving on.

Many acts are performed within us without any participation of what is called consciousness.

Many adjustments and readjustments occur in our organism without consciousness participating in them.

The motor centre of our body can drive a car or direct the fingers that touch the keyboard of a piano without the slightest participation of consciousness.

Consciousness is the light that the unconscious does not perceive.

The blind person does not perceive the physical sunlight either, but it exists by itself.

We need to open ourselves up so that the light of consciousness can penetrate the frightful darkness of the self.

Now we will better understand the meaning of the words of John, when in the Gospel he says: "The light came into the darkness, but the darkness did not understand it."

But it would be impossible for the light of consciousness to penetrate into the darkness of the self if we did not first use the wonderful sense of psychological self-observation.

We need to open the way for the light to illuminate the dark depths of the Psychology Self.

One would never self-observe if one were not interested in changing; such interest is only possible when one truly loves esoteric teachings.

Now our readers will understand why we advise re-evaluating the instructions concerning work on oneself again and again.

Awakened consciousness allows us to experience reality directly.

Unfortunately, the intellectual animal, mistakenly called man, fascinated by the formulating power of dialectical logic, has forgotten the dialectic of consciousness.

Undoubtedly, the power to formulate logical concepts is ultimately terribly poor.

From the thesis we can move to the antithesis and through discussion reach the synthesis, but the latter in itself remains an intellectual concept that in no way can coincide with reality.

The Dialectic of Consciousness is more direct, allowing us to experience the reality of any phenomenon in itself.

Natural phenomena do not exactly coincide with the concepts formulated by the mind.

Life unfolds from moment to moment, and when we capture it to analyse it, we kill it.

When we try to infer concepts by observing such or such a natural phenomenon, we actually stop perceiving the reality of the phenomenon and only see in it the reflection of the stale theories and concepts that have nothing to do with the observed fact.

Intellectual hallucination is fascinating, and we want all the phenomena of nature to coincide with our dialectical logic.

The dialectic of consciousness is based on lived experiences and not on mere subjective rationalism.

All the laws of nature exist within ourselves, and if we do not discover them within ourselves, we will never discover them outside of ourselves.

Man is contained in the Universe, and the Universe is contained in man.

What one experiences within oneself is real; only consciousness can experience reality.

The language of consciousness is symbolic, intimate, deeply meaningful, and only the awakened can understand it.

Anyone who wants to awaken consciousness must eliminate from within all the undesirable elements that constitute the Ego, the Self, within which the essence is bottled up.
