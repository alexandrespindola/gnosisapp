Christ is the Fire of Fire, the Flame of Flame, the Astral Signature of Fire.

Above the Cross of the Martyr of Calvary is defined the Mystery of Christ with a single word consisting of four letters: INRI. Ignis Natura Renovatur Integram - Fire constantly renews Nature.

The Advent of Christ in the heart of man radically transforms us.

Christ is the SOLAR LOGOS, perfect Multiple Unity. Christ is the life that pulsates in the entire universe, is what is, what always has been and what always will be.

Much has been said about the Cosmic Drama; undoubtedly this Drama is formed by the four gospels.

We have been told that the Cosmic Drama was brought by the Elohim to the earth; the Great Lord of Atlantis represented this drama in Flesh and Blood.

The Great KABIR JESUS also had to represent the same Drama Publicly in the Holy Land.

Even if Christ is born a thousand times in Bethlehem, it is of no use if he is not also born in our heart.

Even if he had Died and risen on the third day from among the dead, it is of no use if he does not die and rise in us as well.

To try to discover the nature and essence of fire is to try to discover God, whose real presence has always been revealed under the fiery appearance.

The burning bush (Exodus, III, 2) and the fire of Sinai following the granting of the Decalogue (Exodus, XIX, 18): are two manifestations by which God appeared to Moses.

Under the figure of a being of Jasper and Sardonyx the colour of flame, sitting on an incandescent and glittering Throne, Saint John describes the owner of the Universe. (Revelation, IV, 3,5). "Our God is a Devouring Fire," writes Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews.

The intimate Christ, the Celestial Fire, must be born in us and is actually born when we have advanced enough in the Psychological work.

The intimate Christ must eliminate from our Psychological Nature, the very causes of error; the CAUSE EGOS.

The dissolution of the causes of the EGO would not be possible unless the Intimate Christ has been born in us.

The living and Philosophical fire, the intimate Christ, is the Fire of Fire, the pure of the pure.

The Fire envelops us and bathes us everywhere, it comes to us through the air, through the water and through the very earth that are conservatives and their various vehicles.

The Celestial Fire must crystallise in us, it is the intimate Christ, our deep interior Saviour.

The Intimate Lord must take charge of all our Psyche of the Five Cylinders of the Organic machine; of all our Mental, Emotional, Motor, Instinctive and Sexual processes.
