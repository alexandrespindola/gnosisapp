Undoubtedly, just as there is the External Country in which we live, so too in our intimacy exists the psychological country.

People are never unaware of the city or region where they live, unfortunately they are unaware of the psychological place where they are located.

At any given moment, anyone knows which neighbourhood or district they are in, but in the psychological terrain the same does not happen, normally people don't even remotely suspect at any given moment the place in their psychological country where they have ended up.

Just as in the physical world there are neighbourhoods of decent and cultured people, so too in the psychological region of each of us; there is no doubt that there are very elegant and beautiful neighbourhoods.

Just as in the physical world there are neighbourhoods or districts with very dangerous alleyways, full of muggers, so too the same happens in the psychological region of our interior.

Everything depends on the kind of people who accompany us; if we have drunk friends we will end up in the tavern, and if the latter are hell-raisers, undoubtedly our destiny will be in brothels.

Within our psychological country each one has their companions, their EGOS, these will take one to where they should take them according to their psychological characteristics.

A virtuous and honourable lady, a magnificent wife, of exemplary conduct, living in a beautiful mansion in the physical world, due to her lustful EGOS could be located in dens of prostitution within her psychological country.

An honourable gentleman, of impeccable honesty, a magnificent citizen, could within his psychological region find himself located in a den of thieves, due to his terrible companions, EGOS of theft, deeply submerged within the unconscious.

A hermit and penitent, possibly a monk thus living austerely within his cell, in some monastery, could psychologically find himself located in a colony of murderers, gunmen, robbers, drug addicts, precisely due to infraconscious or unconscious EGOS, submerged deep within the most difficult recesses of his psyche.

There is a reason we have been told that there is much virtue in the wicked and that there is much wickedness in the virtuous.

Many canonised saints still live within the psychological dens of theft or in houses of prostitution.

What we are affirming emphatically could scandalise the bigoted, the pietists, the enlightened ignoramuses, the paragons of wisdom, but never true psychologists.

Incredibly though it may seem, among the incense of prayer crime is also hidden, among the cadences of verse crime is also hidden, under the sacred dome of the most divine sanctuaries crime is clothed with the tunic of sanctity and the sublime word.

Among the deep depths of the most venerable saints, live the EGOS of the brothel, of theft, of homicide, etc.

Infrahuman companions hidden among the unfathomable depths of the unconscious.

The various saints of history suffered greatly for this reason; let us remember the temptations of Saint Anthony, all those abominations against which our brother Francis of Assisi had to fight.

However, not all these saints said, and most of the anchorites remained silent.

One is amazed to think that some penitent and most holy anchorites live in the psychological colonies of prostitution and theft.

However, they are saints, and if they have not yet discovered these frightful things of their psyche, when they discover them they will wear hair shirts on their flesh, they will fast, possibly they will flog themselves, and they will beg their divine mother KUNDALINI to eliminate from their psyche those bad companions that in those tenebrous dens of their own psychological country has them trapped.

The different religions have said much about life after death and the afterlife.

Let poor people no longer rack their brains about what there is on the other side, beyond the tomb.

Undoubtedly after death each one continues living in the psychological colony of always.

The thief in the dens of thieves will continue; the lustful in the houses of assignation will continue as a ghost of ill omen; the wrathful, the furious will continue living in the dangerous alleyways of vice and anger, there also where the dagger shines and the gunshots of pistols sound.

The essence in itself is very beautiful, it came from above, from the stars and unfortunately it is trapped within all these egos that we carry within.

By opposition the essence can retrace its path, return to the original starting point, return to the stars, but it must first free itself from its bad companions who have it trapped in the suburbs of perdition.

When Francis of Assisi and Anthony of Padua, distinguished Christified masters, discovered within their interior the egos of perdition, they suffered unspeakably and there is no doubt that on the basis of conscious work and voluntary suffering they managed to reduce to cosmic dust all that set of inhuman elements that lived in their interior. Undoubtedly those Saints Christified themselves and returned to the original starting point after having suffered greatly.

Above all it is necessary, it is urgent, it cannot be postponed, that the magnetic centre that we have abnormally established in our false personality, be transferred to the Essence, thus the complete man will be able to begin his journey from the personality to the stars, ascending in a didactic progressive way, from grade to grade by the mountain of BEING.

As long as the magnetic centre continues to be established in our illusory personality we will live in the most abominable psychological dens, even though in practical life we are magnificent citizens.

Each one has a magnetic centre that characterises them; the merchant has the magnetic centre of commerce and therefore operates in the markets and attracts what is akin to him, buyers and merchants.

The man of science has in his personality the magnetic centre of science and therefore attracts to himself all things of science, books, laboratories, etc.

The Esotericist has within himself the magnetic centre of esotericism, and since this kind of centre becomes different from the questions of personality, undoubtedly the transfer happens for that reason.

When the magnetic centre is established in the conscience, that is to say, in the essence, then the return of the total man to the stars begins.
