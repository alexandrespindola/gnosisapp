The psychological splitting of man allows us to evidence the raw realism of a higher level in each of us.

When one has been able to verify for oneself directly the concrete fact of two men in oneself, the inferior at the normal, common and ordinary level, the superior in a higher octave, then everything changes and in this case we try to act in life according to the fundamental principles that lie deep within one's BEING.

Just as there is an external life, so too is there an internal life.

The external man is not everything, psychological splitting teaches us the reality of the internal man.

The external man has his way of being, he is a thing with multiple attitudes and typical reactions in life, a puppet moved by invisible strings.

The internal man is the authentic BEING, he is processed in other very different laws, he could never be turned into a robot.

The external man does not take a stitch without a thimble, feels he has been paid badly, pities himself, overestimates himself, if he is a soldier he aspires to be a general, if he is a factory worker he protests when he is not promoted, he wants his merits to be duly recognised, etc.

No one could reach the SECOND birth, be reborn as the Gospel of the Lord says, as long as he continues to live with the psychology of the inferior, common and ordinary man.

When one recognises one's own nothingness and inner misery, when one has the courage to review one's life, one undoubtedly comes to know for oneself that in no way does one possess merits of any kind.

"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

Poor in spirit or destitute of spirit, are really those who recognise their own nothingness, shamelessness and inner misery. That kind of being unquestionably receives illumination.

"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."

It is ostensible that the mind enriched by so many merits, decorations and medals, distinguished social virtues and complicated academic theories, is not poor in spirit and therefore could never enter the kingdom of heaven.

To enter the Kingdom, the treasure of faith is essential. Until psychological splitting has occurred in each of us, FAITH is more than impossible.

FAITH is pure knowledge, direct experimental wisdom.

FAITH was always confused with vain beliefs, we Gnostics must never fall into such a grave error.

FAITH is direct experience of the real; magnificent experience of the internal man; authentic divine cognition.

The internal man, when knowing by direct mystical experience his own internal worlds, is ostensible that he also knows the internal worlds of all the people who populate the face of the earth.

No one could know the internal worlds of planet Earth, of the solar system and of the galaxy in which we live, if he has not first known his own internal worlds. This is similar to the suicide who escapes from life through a false door.

The extra perceptions of the drug addict have their particular root in the abominable KUNDARTIGUADOR organ (the tempting serpent of Eden).

The consciousness bottled up among the multiple elements that constitute the Ego is processed by virtue of its own bottling.

The egoic consciousness becomes, therefore, in a comatose state, with hypnotic hallucinations very similar to those of any subject who is under the influence of this or that drug.

We can pose this question in the following form: hallucinations of the egoic consciousness are equal to the hallucinations provoked by drugs.

Obviously, these two types of hallucinations have their original causes in the abominable KUNDARTIGUADOR organ. (See chapter XVI of this book).

Undoubtedly drugs annihilate the alpha rays, then unquestionably the intrinsic connection between mind and brain is lost; this in fact results in total failure.

The drug addict turns vice into religion and misguidedly thinks to experience the real under the influence of drugs, ignoring that the extra-perceptions produced by marijuana, L.S.D., morphine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, cocaine, heroin, hashish, tranquillisers in excess, amphetamines, barbiturates, etc., etc., etc., are mere hallucinations elaborated by the abominable KUNDARTIGUADOR organ.

Drug addicts involuting, degenerating in time, finally submerge definitively within the infernal worlds.
