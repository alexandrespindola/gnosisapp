Some psychologists symbolise consciousness as a knife very capable of separating us from what is stuck to us and extracts strength from us.

Such psychologists believe that the only way to escape the power of this or that self is to observe it with increasing clarity in order to understand it and become aware of it.

Those people think that this is how one eventually separates from this or that self, even if it is by the thickness of the blade of a knife.

In this way, they say, the self separated by consciousness appears like a cut plant.

Becoming aware of any self, according to them, means separating it from our psyche and condemning it to death.

Unquestionably, such a concept, apparently very convincing, fails in practice.

The self that has been cut off from our personality by the knife of consciousness, thrown out of the house like a black sheep, continues in the psychological space, becomes a tempting demon, insists on returning home, does not resign so easily, in no way wants to eat the bitter bread of banishment, looks for an opportunity and at the slightest oversight of the guard, settles back into our psyche.

The most serious thing is that a certain percentage of essence, of consciousness, is always bottled up inside the banished self.

All those psychologists who think this way have never managed to dissolve any of their selves; in reality, they have failed.

No matter how much one tries to evade the issue of Kundalini, the problem is very serious.

In reality, the "Ungrateful Son" never progresses in the esoteric work on himself.

Obviously, the "Ungrateful Son" is anyone who despises "ISIS", our Divine Cosmic Mother, particular, individual.

ISIS is one of the autonomous parts of our own Being, but derived, the fiery serpent of our magical powers, the Kundalini.

Ostensibly, only "ISIS" has absolute power to disintegrate any self; this is irrefutable, undeniable, incontrovertible.

Kundalini is a compound word: "Kunda reminds us of the abominable Kundartiguador organ", "Lini is an Atlantean term that means End".

"Kundalini" means: "End of the abominable Kundartiguador organ". It is therefore urgent not to confuse "Kundalini" with "Kundartiguador".

We already said in a past chapter that the Fiery Serpent of our magical powers is coiled three and a half times inside a certain Magnetic Centre located in the Coccyx bone, base of the spine.

When the Serpent rises, it is Kundalini; when it descends, it is the abominable Kundartiguador organ.

Through "White Tantrism" the serpent ascends victoriously through the spinal medullary canal, awakening the powers that divinise.

Through "Black Tantrism" the serpent precipitates from the coccyx to the atomic hells of man. This is how many become terribly perverse Demons.

Those who make the mistake of attributing to the ascending serpent all the left-hand and dark characteristics of the descending serpent, definitively fail in the work on themselves.

The bad consequences of the "ABOMINABLE KUNDARTIGUADOR ORGAN" can only be annihilated with the "KUNDALINI".

It is worth clarifying that such bad consequences are crystallised in the PLURALISED SELF of revolutionary psychology.

The hypnotic power of the descending Serpent has humanity submerged in unconsciousness.

Only the ascending Serpent, by opposition, can awaken us; this truth is an axiom of Hermetic Wisdom. Now we will better understand the deep significance of the sacred word "KUNDALINI".

Conscious Will is always represented by the sacred woman, Mary, ISIS, who crushes the head of the descending Serpent.

I declare here frankly and without ambiguity that the double current of light, the living and astral fire of the earth, has been figured by the serpent with the head of a bull, a goat or a dog in the Ancient Mysteries.

It is the double Serpent of the Caduceus of Mercury; it is the tempting Serpent of Eden; but it is also, without the slightest doubt, the Copper Serpent of Moses intertwined in the "TAU", that is, in the "Generating LINGAM".

It is the "He Goat" of the Sabbath and the Baphomet of the Gnostic Templars; the HYLE of Universal Gnosticism; the double tail of a serpent that forms the legs of the Solar Rooster of the ABRAXAS.

In the "BLACK LINGAM" embedded in the metallic "YONI", symbols of the God SHIVA, the Hindu Divinity, is the secret key to awaken and develop the ascending Serpent or Kundalini, provided that the "Vessel of Hermes Trismegistus", the Thrice Great God "IBIS OF THOTH", is never spilled in life.

We have spoken between the lines for those who know how to understand. Let him who has understanding understand, for here is wisdom.

The black TANTRIKAS are different; they awaken and develop the Abominable Kundartiguador organ, the tempting Serpent of Eden, when they commit the unforgivable crime of spilling the "Sacred Wine" in their rites.
