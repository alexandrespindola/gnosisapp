In deep inner work, within the terrain of strict psychological self-observation, we must experience the entire cosmic drama directly.

The Intimate Christ must eliminate all the undesirable elements that we carry within us.

The multiple psychic aggregates in our psychological depths cry out for the crucifixion of the inner lord.

Unquestionably, each of us carries the three traitors within our psyche.

Judas, the demon of desire; Pilate, the demon of the mind; Caiaphas, the demon of ill will.

These three traitors crucified the lord of perfections in the very depths of our soul.

These are three specific types of fundamental inhuman elements in the cosmic drama.

Undoubtedly, the aforementioned drama has always been lived secretly in the depths of the superlative consciousness of the being.

The cosmic drama is not, therefore, the property of the Great Kabir Jesus, as the enlightened ignoramuses always assume.

The Initiates of all ages, the Masters of all centuries, have had to live the cosmic drama within themselves, here and now.

However, Jesus the Great Kabir had the courage to represent such an intimate drama publicly, in the street and in broad daylight, to open the meaning of initiation to all human beings, without differences of race, sex, caste or colour.

It is wonderful that there should be someone who publicly teaches the intimate drama to all the peoples of the earth.

The Intimate Christ, not being a lustful being, must eliminate from himself the psychological elements of lust.

The Intimate Christ, being in himself peace and love, must eliminate from himself the undesirable elements of anger.

The Intimate Christ, not being a covetous being, must eliminate from himself the undesirable elements of greed.

The Intimate Christ, not being envious, must eliminate from himself the psychic aggregates of envy.

The Intimate Christ, being perfect humility, infinite modesty, absolute simplicity, must eliminate from himself the disgusting elements of pride, vanity, conceit.

The Intimate Christ, the word, the Creating Logos, always living in constant activity, has to eliminate within ourselves, in himself and by himself, the undesirable elements of inertia, laziness, stagnation.

The Lord of Perfection, accustomed to all fasts, temperate, never a friend of drunkenness and great banquets, has to eliminate from himself the abominable elements of gluttony.

A strange symbiosis, that of Christ-Jesus; the Christ-Man; a rare mixture of the divine and the human, of the perfect and the imperfect; a constant test for the Logos.

The most interesting thing of all this is that the secret Christ is always a triumphant being; someone who constantly overcomes the darkness; someone who eliminates the darkness within himself, here and now.

The Secret Christ is the lord of the Great Rebellion, rejected by the priests, by the elders and by the scribes of the temple.

The priests hate him; that is, they do not understand him, they want the Lord of Perfections to live exclusively in time according to their unbreakable dogmas.

The elders, that is, the inhabitants of the earth, the good householders, the sensible people, the people of experience, abhor the Logos, the Red Christ, the Christ of the Great Rebellion, because he leaves the world of their antiquated, reactionary and petrified habits and customs in many yesterdays.

The scribes of the temple, the rogues of the intellect, abhor the Intimate Christ because he is the antithesis of the Antichrist, the declared enemy of all that rottenness of university theories that so abounds in the markets of bodies and souls.

The three traitors mortally hate the Secret Christ and lead him to death within ourselves and in our own psychological space.

Judas, the demon of desire, always exchanges the lord for thirty pieces of silver, that is, for liquors, money, fame, vanities, fornications, adulteries, etc.

Pilate, the demon of the mind, always washes his hands, always declares himself innocent, is never to blame, constantly justifies himself to himself and to others, seeks evasions, escapes to avoid his own responsibilities, etc.

Caiaphas, the demon of ill will, incessantly betrays the lord within ourselves; the Adorable Intimate gives him the staff to shepherd his sheep, however, the cynical traitor turns the altar into a bed of pleasures, incessantly fornicates, commits adultery, sells the sacraments, etc.

These three traitors secretly make the adorable intimate lord suffer without any compassion.

Pilate makes him put a crown of thorns on his temples, the evil egos flagellate him, insult him, curse him in the intimate psychological space without pity of any kind.
