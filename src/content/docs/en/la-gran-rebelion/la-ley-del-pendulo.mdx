It's interesting to have a wall clock at home, not only to know the time but also to reflect a little.

Without the pendulum, the clock doesn't work; the movement of the pendulum is deeply meaningful.

In ancient times, the dogma of evolution did not exist; therefore, the wise understood that historical processes always unfold according to the Law of the Pendulum.

Everything flows and ebbs, rises and falls, grows and decreases, goes and comes according to this wonderful Law.

It is not strange that everything oscillates, that everything is subject to the ebb and flow of time, that everything evolves and devolves.

At one extreme of the pendulum is joy, at the other is pain; all our emotions, thoughts, yearnings, desires, oscillate according to the Law of the Pendulum.

Hope and despair, pessimism and optimism, passion and pain, triumph and failure, gain and loss, certainly correspond to the two extremes of the pendulum movement.

Egypt arose with all its power and dominion on the banks of the sacred river, but when the pendulum went to the other side, when it rose at the opposite extreme, the land of the pharaohs fell and Jerusalem, the beloved city of the Prophets, arose.

Israel fell when the pendulum changed position, and the Roman Empire arose at the other extreme.

The pendulum movement raises and sinks Empires, gives rise to powerful Civilisations and then destroys them, etc.

We can place the various pseudo-esoteric and pseudo-occult schools, religions and sects at the right end of the pendulum.

We can place all schools of a materialistic, Marxist, atheistic, sceptical type, etc., at the left end of the pendulum movement. Antithesis of the pendulum movement, changing, subject to incessant permutation.

The religious fanatic, due to any unusual event or disappointment, can go to the other extreme of the pendulum, become an atheist, materialist, sceptic.

The fanatical materialist, atheist, due to any unusual event, perhaps a transcendental metaphysical event, a moment of unspeakable terror, can be taken to the opposite extreme of the pendulum movement and become an unbearable religious reactionary.

Examples: A priest defeated in a polemic by an Esotericist, in desperation became an unbeliever and materialist.

We knew the case of an atheistic and incredulous lady who, due to a conclusive and definitive metaphysical event, became a magnificent exponent of practical esotericism.

In the name of truth, we must declare that the true and absolute materialist atheist is a farce, he does not exist.

In the face of the proximity of an inevitable death, in the face of an instant of unspeakable terror, the enemies of the eternal, the materialists and unbelievers, instantly pass to the other extreme of the pendulum and end up praying, crying and clamouring with infinite faith and enormous devotion.

Even Karl Marx, author of Dialectical Materialism, was a fanatical Jewish religious man, and after his death, he was given funeral pomp of a great rabbi.

Karl Marx elaborated his Materialist Dialectic with one sole purpose: "TO CREATE A WEAPON TO DESTROY ALL THE RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD THROUGH SCEPTICISM".

It is the typical case of religious jealousy taken to the extreme; in no way could Marx accept the existence of other religions and preferred to destroy them by means of his Dialectic.

Karl Marx fulfilled one of the Protocols of Zion which says verbatim: "It does not matter that we fill the world with materialism and repugnant atheism, the day we triumph, we will teach the religion of Moses duly codified and in dialectical form, and we will not allow any other religion in the world."

It is very interesting that in the Soviet Union religions are persecuted and the people are taught materialist dialectic, while in the synagogues the Talmud, the Bible and religion are studied, and they work freely without any problem.

The masters of the Russian government are religious fanatics of the Law of Moses, but they poison the people with that farce of Dialectical Materialism.

We would never speak out against the people of Israel; we are only declaring against a certain double-dealing elite who, pursuing unconfessable ends, poison the people with Materialist Dialectic, while in secret they practice the religion of Moses.

Materialism and spiritualism, with all their sequel of theories, prejudices and pre-concepts of all kinds, are processed in the mind according to the Law of the Pendulum and change fashion according to the times and customs.

Spirit and matter are two very debatable and thorny concepts that no one understands.

The mind knows nothing about the spirit, nothing about matter.

A concept is nothing more than that, a concept. Reality is not a concept although the mind can forge many concepts about reality.

The spirit is the spirit (The Being), and only itself can know itself.

It is written: "THE BEING IS THE BEING AND THE REASON FOR BEING IS THE SAME BEING".

The fanatics of the God matter, the scientists of Dialectical Materialism are empirical and absurd in one hundred percent. They talk about matter with a dazzling and stupid self-sufficiency, when in reality they know nothing about it.

What is matter? Which of these foolish scientists knows? The much-vaunted matter is also a concept too debatable and quite thorny.

What is matter? Cotton? Iron? Meat? Starch? A stone? Copper? A cloud or what? To say that everything is matter would be as empirical and absurd as to assure that the whole human organism is a liver, or a heart or a kidney. Obviously one thing is one thing and another thing is another thing, each organ is different and each substance is different. So, which of all these substances is the much-vaunted matter?

Many people play with the concepts of the pendulum, but in reality the concepts are not reality.

The mind only knows illusory forms of nature, but knows nothing about the truth contained in such forms.

Theories go out of fashion with time and with the years, and what one learned at school turns out to be useless later; conclusion: no one knows anything.

The concepts of the extreme right or the extreme left of the pendulum pass like women's fashions, all those are processes of the mind, things that happen on the surface of understanding, nonsense, vanities of the intellect.

Any psychological discipline is opposed by another discipline, any logically structured psychological process is opposed by another similar one, and after all, what?

The real, the truth, is what interests us; but this is not a question of the pendulum, it is not found between the ebb and flow of theories and beliefs.

The truth is the unknown from instant to instant, from moment to moment.

The truth is in the centre of the pendulum, not on the extreme right and not on the extreme left.

When Jesus was asked: What is the truth?, he kept a deep silence. And when the Buddha was asked the same question, he turned his back and withdrew.

The truth is not a question of opinions, nor of theories, nor of prejudices of the extreme right or of the extreme left.

The concept that the mind can forge about the truth is never the truth.

The idea that the understanding has about the truth is never the truth.

The opinion we have about the truth, however respectable it may be, is in no way the truth.

Neither spiritualist currents nor their materialist opponents can ever lead us to the truth.

The truth is something that must be experienced directly, as when one puts one's finger in the fire and gets burned, or as when one swallows water and drowns.

The centre of the pendulum is within ourselves, and it is there where we must discover and directly experience the real, the truth.

We need to self-explore directly in order to self-discover and know ourselves deeply.

The experience of truth only comes when we have eliminated the undesirable elements that together constitute the self.

Only by eliminating error does truth come. Only by disintegrating the "Self", my errors, my prejudices and fears, my passions and desires, beliefs and fornications, intellectual entrenchments and self-sufficiencies of all kinds, does the experience of the real come to us.

The truth has nothing to do with what has been said or left unsaid, with what has been written or left unwritten, it only comes to us when the "self" has died.

The mind cannot seek the truth because it does not know it. The mind cannot recognise the truth because it has never known it. The truth comes to us spontaneously when we have eliminated all the undesirable elements that constitute the "self", the "ego".

As long as consciousness continues bottled up within the self, it will not be able to experience that which is real, that which is beyond the body, affections and mind, that which is the truth.

When the self is reduced to cosmic dust, consciousness is freed to awaken definitively and directly experience the truth.

With just reason said the Great Kabir Jesus: "KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WILL SET YOU FREE".

What good does it do a man to know fifty thousand theories if he has never experienced the Truth?

The intellectual system of any man is very respectable, but any system is opposed by another and neither one nor the other is the truth.

It is better to self-explore in order to self-know and experience one day in a direct way, the real, the TRUTH.
