The multiple subjective elements that constitute the ego have causal roots.

The cause-selves are linked to the laws of Cause and Effect. Obviously, there cannot be cause without effect, nor effect without cause; this is unquestionable, indubitable.

It would be inconceivable to eliminate the various inhuman elements that we carry within us if we did not radically eliminate the intrinsic causes of our psychological defects.

Obviously, the cause-selves are intimately associated with certain karmic debts.

Only the deepest repentance and the respective dealings with the lords of the law can give us the joy of achieving the disintegration of all those causal elements that in one way or another can lead us to the definitive elimination of undesirable elements.

The intrinsic causes of our errors can certainly be eradicated from themselves thanks to the efficient works of the Intimate Christ.

Obviously, the cause-selves tend to have frighteningly difficult complexities.

Example: An esoteric student could be defrauded by their instructor and in sequence such a neophyte would become sceptical. In this specific case, the cause-self that originated such an error could only be disintegrated through supreme inner repentance and very special esoteric negotiations.

The Intimate Christ within ourselves works intensively, eliminating through conscious work and voluntary suffering all those secret causes of our errors.

The lord of perfections must live in our intimate depths the entire cosmic drama.

One is amazed to contemplate in the causal world all the tortures through which the Lord of Perfections passes.

In the causal world, the secret Christ goes through all the unspeakable bitterness of his Via Crucis.

Undoubtedly, Pilate washes his hands and justifies himself, but in the end condemns the adorable one to the death of the cross.

The ascent to Calvary is extraordinary for the initiate seer.

Undoubtedly, the solar consciousness integrated with the Intimate Christ, crucified on the majestic cross of Calvary, pronounces terrible phrases that human beings are not able to understand.

The final phrase (Father, into your hands I commend my spirit) is followed by lightning and thunder and great cataclysms.

Subsequently, the Intimate Christ, after being taken down, is deposited in his Holy Sepulchre.

Through death, the Intimate Christ kills death. Much later in time, the Intimate Christ must resurrect in us.

Unquestionably, the Christic resurrection comes to transform us radically.

Any Resurrected Master possesses extraordinary powers over fire, air, water, and earth.

Undoubtedly, the Resurrected Masters acquire immortality, not only psychological but also corporeal.

Jesus The Great Kabir still lives with the same physical body he had in the Holy Land; The Count of Saint Germain, who transmuted lead into gold and made diamonds of the best quality during the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th centuries, etc., still lives today.

The enigmatic and powerful Count Cagliostro, who so astonished Europe with his powers during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, is a Resurrected Master and still retains his same physical body.
