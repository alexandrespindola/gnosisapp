The meaning of Freedom is something that has not yet been understood by Humanity.

Regarding the concept of Freedom, always presented in a more or less incorrect way, very serious mistakes have been made.

Certainly, people fight for a word, draw absurd deductions, commit abuses of all kinds and spill blood on the battlefields.

The word Freedom is fascinating, everyone likes it, however, there is no true understanding of it, there is confusion in relation to this word.

It is not possible to find a dozen people who define the word Freedom in the same way and in the same manner.

The term Freedom would in no way be comprehensible to subjective rationalism.

Each one has different ideas about this term: subjective opinions of people devoid of all objective reality.

When raising the question of Freedom, there is incoherence, vagueness, incongruity in each mind.

I am sure that not even Don Emmanuel Kant, the author of the Critique of Pure Reason, and the Critique of Practical Reason, ever analysed this word to give it the exact meaning.

Freedom, beautiful word, beautiful term: How many crimes have been committed in its name!

Unquestionably, the term Freedom has hypnotised the multitudes; the mountains and the valleys, the rivers and the seas have been stained with blood at the spell of this magical word.

How many flags, how much blood and how many heroes have succeeded in the course of History, each time that the question of Freedom has been placed on the table of life.

Unfortunately, after all the independence achieved at such a high price, slavery continues within each person.

Who is free? Who has achieved the famous freedom? How many have emancipated themselves? Alas, alas, alas!

The adolescent longs for freedom; it seems incredible that many times having bread, shelter, and refuge, one wants to flee from the paternal home in search of freedom.

It is incongruous that the young man who has everything at home, wants to evade, flee, move away from his dwelling, fascinated by the term freedom. It is strange that enjoying all kinds of comforts in a happy home, one wants to lose what one has, to travel through those lands of the world and immerse oneself in pain.

That the unfortunate, the outcast of life, the beggar, truly yearns to move away from the hovel, from the shack, with the purpose of obtaining some better change, is correct; but that the well-off child, the mummy's boy, seeks escape, flight, is incongruous and even absurd; however, this is so; the word Freedom, fascinates, bewitches, although no one knows how to define it in a precise way.

That the maiden wants freedom, that she yearns to change house, that she wants to marry to escape from the paternal home and live a better life, is partly logical, because she has the right to be a mother; however, already in the life of a wife, she finds that she is not free, and with resignation she has to continue carrying the chains of slavery.

The employee, tired of so many regulations, wants to be free, and if he manages to become independent, he encounters the problem that he continues to be a slave to his own interests and concerns.

Certainly, every time we fight for Freedom, we find ourselves disappointed despite the victories.

So much blood shed uselessly in the name of Freedom, and yet we continue to be slaves to ourselves and to others.

People fight over words they never understand, even though dictionaries explain them grammatically.

Freedom is something that must be achieved within oneself. No one can achieve it outside of oneself.

Riding through the air is a very oriental phrase that allegorises the meaning of genuine Freedom.

No one could really experience Freedom as long as their consciousness remains bottled up in the self, in the myself.

Understanding this myself, my person, what I am, is urgent when one wants very sincerely to achieve Freedom.

In no way could we destroy the shackles of slavery without having previously understood all this question of mine, all this that concerns the I, the myself.

What does slavery consist of? What is it that keeps us enslaved? What are these obstacles? All this is what we need to discover.

Rich and poor, believers and unbelievers, are all formally imprisoned even though they consider themselves free.

As long as the consciousness, the essence, the most dignified and decent that we have within us, continues bottled up in the self, in the myself, in the I myself, in my appetites and fears, in my desires and passions, in my worries and violences, in my psychological defects; one will be in formal prison.

The meaning of Freedom can only be fully understood when the shackles of our own psychological prison have been annihilated.

While the "myself" exists, consciousness will be in prison; escaping from prison is only possible through Buddhist annihilation, dissolving the I, reducing it to ashes, to cosmic dust.

Free consciousness, devoid of I, in absolute absence of myself, without desires, without passions, without appetites or fears, directly experiences true Freedom.

Any concept about Freedom is not Freedom. The opinions that we form about Freedom are far from being Reality. The ideas that we forge about the theme of Freedom, have nothing to do with authentic Freedom.

Freedom is something that we have to experience directly, and this is only possible by dying psychologically, dissolving the I, ending forever with the myself.

It would be useless to continue dreaming of Freedom, if we continue as slaves anyway.

It is better to see ourselves as we are, to carefully observe all these shackles of slavery that keep us in formal prison.

By self-knowing ourselves, seeing what we are internally, we will discover the door to authentic Freedom.
