Who or what can guarantee that the concept and the reality are absolutely the same?

The concept is one thing and reality is another, and there is a tendency to overestimate our own concepts.

Reality being equal to concept is almost impossible, however, the mind hypnotised by its own concept always assumes that the two are the same.

To any psychological process correctly structured using exact logic, another different one, robustly formed with similar or superior logic, is opposed, so what then?

Two minds severely disciplined within rigid intellectual structures arguing with each other, polemicising, about such and such a reality, each believing in the accuracy of their own concept and in the falsity of the other's concept, but which of them is right? Who could honestly vouch for one or the other? In which of them do concept and reality turn out to be the same?

Undoubtedly each head is a world and in each and every one of us there exists a kind of pontifical and dictatorial dogmatism that wants to make us believe in the absolute equality of concept and reality.

However strong the structures of a reasoning may be, nothing can guarantee the absolute equality of concepts and reality.

Those who are self-enclosed within any intellectual logistical procedure always want to make the reality of phenomena coincide with elaborate concepts, and this is nothing more than the result of reasonable hallucination.

Opening up to the new is the difficult ease of the classic; unfortunately people want to discover, to see in every natural phenomenon their own prejudices, concepts, preconceptions, opinions and theories; no one knows how to be receptive, to see the new with a clean and spontaneous mind.

That the phenomena should speak to the wise would be the appropriate thing; unfortunately the wise of these times do not know how to see the phenomena, they only want to see in them the confirmation of all their preconceptions.

Incredibly, modern scientists know nothing about natural phenomena.

When we see in the phenomena of nature exclusively our own concepts, we are certainly not seeing the phenomena but the concepts.

But, hallucinated by their fascinating intellect, silly scientists stupidly believe that each of their concepts is absolutely equal to such and such an observed phenomenon, when the reality is different.

We do not deny that our claims are rejected by anyone who is self-enclosed by such and such a logistical procedure; unquestionably, the pontifical and dogmatic condition of the intellect could in no way accept that such and such a correctly elaborated concept does not coincide exactly with reality.

As soon as the mind, through the senses, observes such and such a phenomenon, it immediately hurries to label it with such and such a scientific term which undoubtedly only serves as a patch to cover up its own ignorance.

The mind does not really know how to be receptive to the new, but it does know how to invent very complicated terms with which it pretends to qualify in a self-deceptive way what it certainly ignores.

Speaking this time in a Socratic sense, we will say that the mind not only ignores, but also ignores that it ignores.

The modern mind is terribly superficial, it has specialised in inventing very difficult terms to cover up its own ignorance.

There are two kinds of science: the first is nothing more than that cesspool of subjective theories that abound out there. The second is the pure science of the great enlightened ones, the objective science of the Being.

Undoubtedly, it would not be possible to penetrate into the amphitheatre of cosmic science, if we have not first died in ourselves.

We need to disintegrate all those undesirable elements that we carry inside, and that as a whole constitute, in itself, the Ego of Psychology.

As long as the superlative consciousness of the being continues bottled up between the me myself, between my own concepts and subjective theories, it is absolutely impossible to know directly the raw reality of natural phenomena in themselves.

The key to the laboratory of nature is in the right hand of the Angel of Death.

We can learn very little from the phenomenon of birth, but we can learn everything from death.

The inviolate temple of pure science is found at the bottom of the black grave. If the seed does not die the plant is not born. Only with death does the new come.

When the Ego dies, consciousness awakens to see the reality of all the phenomena of nature as they are in themselves and by themselves.

Consciousness knows what it directly experiences for itself, the raw realism of life beyond the body, affections and the mind.
