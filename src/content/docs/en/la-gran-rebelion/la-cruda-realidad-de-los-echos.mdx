Soon, millions of inhabitants of Africa, Asia and Latin America may die of hunger.

The gas emitted by "Sprays" can radically deplete the ozone in the Earth's atmosphere.

Some wise men predict that by the year 2000, the subsoil of our globe will be exhausted.

Marine species are dying due to the pollution of the seas, this has already been proven.

Undoubtedly, at the rate we're going, by the end of this century, all inhabitants of large cities will have to wear oxygen masks to defend themselves from the smog.

If pollution continues in its current alarming form, it won't be long before it's impossible to eat fish, as those living in such contaminated water will be dangerous to health.

Before the year 2000, it will be almost impossible to find a beach where one can swim in pure water.

Due to the excessive consumption and exploitation of the soil and subsoil, soon the land will no longer be able to produce the agricultural elements necessary to feed the people.

The "Intellectual Animal", mistakenly called man, by contaminating the seas with so much filth, poisoning the air with the smoke from cars and factories, and destroying the Earth with its underground atomic explosions and abuse of elements harmful to the Earth's crust, has clearly subjected Planet Earth to a long and appalling agony that will undoubtedly conclude with a Great Catastrophe.

The world will hardly be able to cross the threshold of the year 2000, as the "Intellectual Animal" is destroying the natural environment at a thousand miles per hour.

The "Rational Mammal", mistakenly called man, is determined to destroy the Earth, wants to make it uninhabitable, and is obviously succeeding.

As far as the Seas are concerned, it is obvious that they have been converted by all nations into a kind of Great Rubbish Dump.

Seventy per cent of all the world's rubbish is going into each of the seas.

Enormous quantities of oil, insecticides of all kinds, multiple chemical substances, poisonous gases, neurotoxic gases, detergents, etc., are annihilating all living species in the Ocean.

Seabirds and Plankton, so indispensable for life, are being destroyed.

Undoubtedly, the annihilation of Marine Plankton is of incalculable gravity because this microorganism produces seventy per cent of the Earth's Oxygen.

Through scientific research, it has been verified that certain parts of the Atlantic and Pacific are already contaminated with radioactive waste, a product of atomic explosions.

In different Metropolises of the world, and especially in Europe, fresh water is drunk, eliminated, purified and then drunk again.

In the great "Super-civilised" cities, the water that is served at the tables passes through human organisms many times.

In the city of Cúcuta, on the border with Venezuela, Republic of Colombia, South America, the inhabitants are forced to drink the black and filthy waters of the river that carries all the filth that comes from Pamplona.

I want to refer emphatically to the Pamplonita River, which has been so disastrous for the "Pearl of the North" (Cúcuta).

Fortunately, there is now another aqueduct that supplies the City, without ceasing to drink the black waters of the Pamplonita River.

Enormous filters, gigantic machines, chemical substances, try to purify the black waters of the great cities of Europe, but epidemics continue to spread with those filthy black waters that have passed through human organisms so many times.

Famous Bacteriologists have found in the drinking water of the great Capitals, all kinds of: viruses, colibacilli, pathogens, Tuberculosis bacteria, Typhoid, Smallpox, Larvae, etc.

Incredibly, within the same Potable water plants in European countries, viruses of the Poliomyelitis vaccine have been found.

In addition, the waste of water is appalling: Modern scientists claim that by the year 1990, the rational humanoid will die of thirst.

The worst of all this is that the underground reserves of fresh water are in danger due to the abuses of the Intellectual Animal.

The merciless exploitation of oil wells continues to be fatal. The oil extracted from the interior of the earth passes through the underground waters and contaminates them.

As a result of this, oil has made the underground waters of the Earth undrinkable for more than a century.

Obviously, as a result of all this, plants die and even a multitude of people.

Let's talk now a little about the air, which is so indispensable for the life of creatures.

With each aspiration and inhalation, the lungs take half a litre of air, that is, about twelve cubic metres a day, multiply that amount by the Four Thousand Five Hundred Million inhabitants that the Earth has, and then we will have the exact amount of oxygen that the entire humanity consumes daily, without counting the oxygen consumed by all the other animal creatures that populate the face of the Earth.

All the Oxygen we inhale is in the atmosphere and is due to the Plankton that we are now destroying with pollution and also to the photosynthetic activity of plants.

Unfortunately, oxygen reserves are already running out.

The Rational Mammal, mistakenly called man, through its countless industries, is continuously decreasing the amount of solar radiation, so necessary and indispensable for photosynthesis, and that is why the amount of Oxygen that plants currently produce is now much less than in the last century.

The most serious thing about this whole world tragedy is that the "Intellectual Animal" continues to pollute the seas, destroying the Plankton and destroying the vegetation.

The "Rational Animal" continues to destroy its sources of Oxygen, unfortunately.

The "Smog", which the "Rational Humanoid" is constantly expelling into the air; in addition to killing, endangers the life of Planet Earth.

The "Smog" is not only annihilating the reserves of Oxygen, but is also killing people.

The "Smog" originates strange and dangerous diseases that are impossible to cure, this has already been proven.

The "Smog" prevents the entry of sunlight and ultraviolet rays, causing serious disorders in the atmosphere.

An era of climatic alterations, glaciations, the advance of polar ice towards the Equator, appalling cyclones, earthquakes, etc. is coming.

Due not to the use, but to the abuse of electrical energy in the year 2000, there will be more heat in some regions of Planet Earth and this will contribute to the process of the Revolution of the Earth's Axes.

Soon the poles will be constituted in the Equator of the Earth, and the latter will become Poles.

Melting of the Poles has begun and a new Universal Flood preceded by fire is approaching.

In the coming decades, "Carbon Dioxide" will multiply, then this chemical element will form a thick layer in the Earth's atmosphere.

Such a filter or layer will unfortunately absorb thermal radiation and act as a greenhouse of fatalities.

The climate of the earth will become hotter in many places and the heat will melt the ice of the Poles, raising the level of the oceans scandalously for this reason.

The situation is very serious, the fertile soil is disappearing and two hundred thousand people who need food are born daily.

The world catastrophe of Famine that is coming is certainly terrifying; this is already at the door.

Currently, forty million people are dying annually from hunger, from lack of food.

The criminal industrialisation of forests and the ruthless exploitation of Mines and Oil are leaving the Earth turned into a desert.

While it is true that nuclear energy is deadly for humanity, it is no less true that there are currently also "Death Rays", "Microbial Bombs" and many other terribly destructive, malignant elements, invented by scientists.

Undoubtedly, to obtain nuclear energy, large amounts of heat are required that are difficult to control and that can at any moment originate a catastrophe.

To achieve nuclear energy, enormous quantities of radioactive minerals are required, of which only thirty per cent are used, this causes the terrestrial subsoil to be depleted rapidly.

The atomic wastes that remain in the subsoil are frighteningly dangerous. There is no safe place for atomic waste.

If the gas from an atomic landfill were to escape, even if only a minimum portion, millions of people would die.

The contamination of food and water brings genetic alterations and human monsters: creatures that are born deformed and monstrous.

Before the year 1999, there will be a serious nuclear accident that will cause true horror.

Certainly humanity does not know how to live, has degenerated frighteningly and frankly has precipitated itself into the abyss.

The most serious thing about this whole question is that the factors of such desolation, such as: famines, wars, destruction of the Planet we live on, etc., are within ourselves, we carry them within ourselves, in our Psyche.
