There are many intellectual rogues everywhere, lacking positive guidance and poisoned by nauseating scepticism.

Certainly, the repugnant poison of scepticism has alarmingly infected human minds since the 18th century.

Before that century, the famous Non-existent or Hidden Island, located off the coast of Spain, was constantly visible and tangible.

There is no doubt that such an island is located within the fourth vertical. There are many anecdotes related to this mysterious island.

After the 18th century, the aforementioned island was lost to eternity, no one knows anything about it.

In the times of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, the elementals of nature manifested everywhere, penetrating deeply into our physical atmosphere.

There are many stories about goblins, genies and fairies that still abound in the green Eire, Ireland; unfortunately, all these innocent things, all this beauty of the soul of the world, is no longer perceived by humanity due to the know-it-all attitude of the intellectual rogues and the disproportionate development of the animal Ego.

Nowadays, the know-it-alls laugh at all these things, they do not accept them even though deep down they have not even remotely achieved happiness.

If people understood that we have three minds, things would be different, they might even be more interested in these studies.

Unfortunately, the enlightened ignoramuses, stuck in the recesses of their difficult erudition, do not even have time to seriously engage with our studies.

These poor people are self-sufficient, they are conceited with vain intellectualism, they think they are on the right path and they do not even remotely suspect that they are in a dead end.

In the name of truth, we must say that in summary, we have three minds.

We can and should call the first one the Sensual Mind, we will baptise the second one with the name Intermediate Mind. We will call the third one the Inner Mind.

We are now going to study each of these three Minds separately and judiciously.

Unquestionably, the Sensual Mind elaborates its concepts of content through external sensory perceptions.

Under these conditions, the Sensual Mind is terribly crude and materialistic, it cannot accept anything that has not been physically demonstrated.

Since the concepts of content of the Sensual Mind are based on external sensory data, undoubtedly it can know nothing about the real, about the truth, about the mysteries of life and death, about the soul and the spirit, etc.

For the intellectual rogues, totally trapped by the external senses and bottled up between the concepts of content of the sensual mind, our esoteric studies are madness to them.

Within the reason of unreason, in the world of the absurd, they are right because they are conditioned by the external sensory world. How could the Sensual Mind accept something that is not sensual?

If the data from the senses serve as a secret spring for all the functionalisms of the Sensual Mind, it is obvious that the latter must originate sensual concepts.

The Intermediate Mind is different, however, it also does not know anything directly about the real, it is limited to believing and that is all.

In the Intermediate Mind are religious beliefs, unwavering dogmas, etc.

The Inner Mind is fundamental for the direct experience of the truth.

Undoubtedly, the Inner Mind elaborates its concepts of content with the data provided by the superlative consciousness of the Being.

Unquestionably, consciousness can experience the real. There is no doubt that consciousness knows the truth.

However, for manifestation, consciousness needs a mediator, an instrument of action and this in itself is the Inner Mind.

Consciousness directly knows the reality of each natural phenomenon and through the Inner Mind can manifest it.

Opening the Inner Mind would be the right thing to do in order to get out of the world of doubts and ignorance.

This means that only by opening the Inner Mind is authentic faith born in the human being.

Looking at this question from another angle, we will say that materialist scepticism is the peculiar characteristic of ignorance. There is no doubt that the enlightened ignoramuses are one hundred percent sceptical.

Faith is direct perception of the real; fundamental wisdom; experience of that which is beyond the body, affections and mind.

Distinguish between faith and belief. Beliefs are deposited in the Intermediate Mind, faith is characteristic of the Inner Mind.

Unfortunately, there is always the general tendency to confuse belief with faith. Although it may seem paradoxical, we will emphasise the following: "HE WHO HAS TRUE FAITH DOES NOT NEED TO BELIEVE".

It is that authentic faith is vivid wisdom, exact cognition, direct experience.

It happens that for many centuries faith has been confused with belief and now it is very difficult to make people understand that faith is true wisdom and never vain beliefs.

The sapient functionalisms of the inner mind have as intimate springs all those formidable data of the wisdom contained in consciousness.

Whoever has opened the Inner Mind remembers their previous lives, knows the mysteries of life and death, not for what they have read or not read, not for what another has said or not said, not for what they have believed or not believed, but by direct, vivid, terribly real experience.

This that we are saying is not liked by the sensual mind, it cannot accept it because it goes out of its domains, it has nothing to do with external sensory perceptions, it is something foreign to its concepts of content, to what they taught it at school, to what it learned in different books, etc., etc., etc.

This that we are saying is also not accepted by the Intermediate Mind because in fact it contradicts its beliefs, it distorts what its religious preceptors made it learn by heart, etc.

Jesus The Great Kabir warns his disciples saying: "Beware of the leaven of the Sadducees and of the leaven of the Pharisees".

It is ostensible that Jesus The Christ with this warning referred to the doctrines of the materialist Sadducees and the hypocritical Pharisees.

The doctrine of the Sadducees is in the Sensual Mind, it is the doctrine of the five senses.

The doctrine of the Pharisees is located in the Intermediate Mind, this is irrefutable, unanswerable.

It is evident that the Pharisees attend their rites so that it is said of them that they are good people, to appear before others, but they never work on themselves.

It would not be possible to open the Inner Mind if we did not learn to think psychologically.

Unquestionably, when someone begins to observe themselves, it is a sign that they have begun to think psychologically.

As long as one does not admit the reality of their own Psychology and the possibility of fundamentally changing it, undoubtedly one does not feel the need for psychological self-observation.

When one accepts the doctrine of the many and understands the need to eliminate the different egos that one carries in their psyche with the purpose of freeing the consciousness, the essence, undoubtedly in fact and by their own right begins psychological self-observation.

Obviously, the elimination of the undesirable elements that we carry in our psyche originates the opening of the Inner Mind.

All this means that the aforementioned opening is something that is carried out gradually, as we annihilate undesirable elements that we carry in our psyche.

Whoever has eliminated the undesirable elements within themselves one hundred percent, obviously will also have opened their inner mind one hundred percent.

A person like this will possess absolute faith. Now you will understand the words of Christ when he said: "If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would move mountains".
