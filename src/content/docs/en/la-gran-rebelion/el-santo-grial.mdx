The Holy Grail gleams in the deep night of all ages. The Knights of the Middle Ages in the time of the Crusades sought the Holy Grail in vain in the Holy Land, but they did not find it.

When Abraham the Prophet returned from the war against the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, it is said that he met Melchizedek the Genius of the Earth. Certainly, that Great Being lived in a fortress located exactly in the place where Jerusalem, the beloved city of the Prophets, was later built.

Legend has it, and this is known by the divine and the human, that Abraham celebrated the Gnostic Unction with the sharing of bread and wine in the presence of Melchizedek.

It is worth stating that Abraham then gave Melchizedek tithes and first fruits as it is written in the Book of the Law.

Abraham received the Holy Grail from the hands of Melchizedek; much later in time this cup ended up in the temple of Jerusalem.

There is no doubt that the Queen of Sheba served as a mediator for this event. She appeared before King Solomon with the Holy Grail and after subjecting him to rigorous tests, she gave him such a precious jewel.

The Great Kabir Jesus drank from that cup in the sacred ceremony of the Last Supper, as it is written in the Four Gospels.

Joseph of Arimathea filled the Chalice with the blood that flowed from the wounds of the Adorable One on the Mount of Skulls.

When the Roman police raided the residence of the aforementioned Senator, they did not find this precious jewel.

The Roman Senator not only hid the precious jewel but also kept the spear of Longinus, with which the Roman centurion wounded the side of the Lord, underground with it.

Joseph of Arimathea was locked in a horrible prison for not wanting to hand over the Holy Grail.

When the aforementioned Senator left prison, he left for Rome carrying the Holy Grail.

Upon arriving in Rome, Joseph of Arimathea found the persecution of Christians by Nero and left along the shores of the Mediterranean.

One night in a dream an angel appeared to him and said: "This chalice has great power because in it is the blood of the Redeemer of the World." Joseph of Arimathea, obeying the orders of the angel, buried such a chalice in a temple located in Montserrat, Catalonia, Spain.

Over time, such a chalice became invisible along with the temple and part of the mountain.

The Holy Grail is the vessel of Hermes, the cup of Solomon, the precious urn of all the temples of mysteries.

In the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail was never missing in the form of the cup or gomor, inside which the manna of the desert was deposited.

The Holy Grail emphatically categorises the feminine YONI, within this holy cup is the nectar of immortality, the Soma of the mystics, the supreme drink of the Holy Gods.

The Red Christ drinks from the Holy Grail in the supreme hour of Christification, as it is written in the Gospel of the Lord.

The Holy Grail is never missing on the altar of the temple. Obviously, the Priest must drink the wine of light in the Holy Cup.

It would be absurd to suppose a temple of mysteries within which the blessed cup of all ages was missing.

This reminds us of Guinevere, the Queen of the Jinn, she who poured wine for Lancelot in the delightful cups of SUFRA and MANTI.

The immortal Gods feed on the drink contained in the Holy Cup; those who hate the Blessed Cup, blaspheme against the holy spirit.

The Super-man must feed on the nectar of immortality contained in the divine chalice of the temple.

Transmutation of creative energy is fundamental when one wants to drink from the Holy Vessel.

The Red Christ, always revolutionary, always rebellious, always heroic, always triumphant, toasts to the Gods drinking from the golden chalice.

Raise your cup well and be careful not to spill even a drop of the precious wine.

Remember that our motto is THELEMA (will).

From the bottom of the chalice - a symbolic figure of the female sexual organ - flames sprout that shine on the flushed face of the Super-Man.

The ineffable Gods of all galaxies always drink of the drink of immortality in the eternal chalice.

The lunar cold produces involutions in time; it is necessary to drink the sacred wine of light in the holy vessel of Alchemy.

The purple of the sacred kings, the royal crown and the flaming gold are only for the Red Christ.

The Lord of Lightning and Thunder wields the Holy Grail in his right hand and drinks the wine of gold to feed himself.

Those who spill the Vessel of Hermes during the chemical copulation, in fact, become subhuman creatures of the sub-world.
