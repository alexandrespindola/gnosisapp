Logical dialectics are conditioned and qualified, furthermore, by the propositions "in" and "about" which never lead us to the direct experience of the real.

The phenomena of nature are far from being as scientists see them.

Certainly, as soon as any phenomenon is discovered, it is immediately qualified or labelled with such-and-such a difficult term from scientific jargon.

Obviously, those extremely difficult terms of modern scientism only serve as a patch to cover up ignorance.

Natural phenomena are by no means as scientists see them.

Life, with all its processes and phenomena, unfolds from moment to moment, from instant to instant, and when the scientific mind stops it to analyse it, it actually kills it.

Any inference drawn from any natural phenomenon is by no means equal to the concrete reality of the phenomenon; unfortunately, the scientist's mind, hallucinating from its own theories, firmly believes in the realism of its inferences.

The hallucinating intellect not only sees in phenomena a reflection of its own concepts, but also, and what is worse, wants in a dictatorial way to make the phenomena be exact and absolutely equal to all those concepts that are carried in the intellect.

The phenomenon of intellectual hallucination is fascinating; none of those ultramodern silly scientists would admit the reality of their own hallucination.

Certainly, the know-it-alls of these times would in no way admit to being described as hallucinating.

The force of auto-suggestion has made them believe in the reality of all those concepts of scientific jargon.

Obviously, the hallucinating mind presumes to be omniscient and in a dictatorial way wants all the processes of nature to run along the lines of its know-it-allness.

No sooner has a new phenomenon appeared, it is classified, labelled and placed in such-and-such a place, as if it had truly been understood.

There are thousands of terms that have been invented to label phenomena, but the pseudo-wise know nothing about the reality of those.

As a lived example of everything we are affirming in this chapter, we will cite the human body.

In the name of truth, we can emphatically affirm that this physical body is absolutely unknown to modern scientists.

A statement of this kind might appear very insolent before the pontiffs of modern scientism, and we undoubtedly deserve excommunication from them.

However, we have very solid bases for making such a tremendous affirmation; unfortunately, hallucinating minds are convinced of their pseudo-wisdom, that they could not even remotely accept the crude realism of their ignorance.

If we were to tell the leaders of modern scientism that the Count of Cagliostro, a very interesting character of the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries, still lives in the 20th century, if we were to tell them that the illustrious Paracelsus, an eminent physician of the Middle Ages, still exists today, you can be sure that the leaders of current scientism would laugh at us and never accept our affirmations.

However, it is so: the authentic mutants, immortal men with bodies dating back thousands and millions of years, currently live on the face of the earth.

The author of this work knows the mutants, but he is not unaware of modern scepticism, the hallucination of the scientists and the state of ignorance of the know-it-alls.

For all this, we would in no way fall into the illusion of believing that the fanatics of scientific jargon would accept the reality of our unusual declarations.

The body of any mutant is a frank challenge to the scientific jargon of these times.

The body of any mutant can change shape and then return to its normal state without receiving any damage.

The body of any mutant can instantly penetrate the fourth vertical and even assume any plant or animal form and subsequently return to its normal state without suffering any harm.

The body of any mutant violently defies old texts of official Anatomy.

Unfortunately, none of these declarations could overcome the hallucinating of scientific jargon.

Those gentlemen, seated on their pontifical thrones, will undoubtedly look at us with disdain, perhaps with anger, and possibly even with a little pity.

But, the truth is what it is, and the reality of the mutants is a frank challenge to all ultramodern theory.

The author of the work knows the mutants but does not expect anyone to believe him.

Each organ of the human body is controlled by laws and forces that the hallucinating of scientific jargon do not even remotely know.

The elements of nature are in themselves unknown to official science; the best chemical formulas are incomplete: H2O, two atoms of Hydrogen and one of Oxygen to form water, is empirical.

If we try to put together in a laboratory the atom of Oxygen with the two of Hydrogen, it does not result in water or anything because this formula is incomplete, it lacks the element fire, only with this cited element could water be created.

Intellection, however brilliant it may seem, can never lead us to the experience of the real.

The classification of substances and the difficult terms with which they are labelled, only serves as a patch to cover up ignorance.

That of the intellect wanting such-and-such a substance to have a certain name and characteristics, is absurd and unbearable.

Why does the intellect presume to be omniscient? Why does it hallucinate believing that substances and phenomena are as it believes they are? Why does intellection want nature to be a perfect replica of all its theories, concepts, opinions, dogmas, preconceptions, prejudices?

In reality, natural phenomena are not as they are believed to be, and the substances and forces of nature are by no means as the intellect thinks they are.

Awake consciousness is not the mind, nor the memory, nor anything similar. Only liberated consciousness can experience for itself and directly the reality of free life in its movement.

But we must emphatically affirm that as long as any subjective element exists within ourselves, consciousness will continue bottled up between such element and therefore will not be able to enjoy continuous and perfect illumination.
