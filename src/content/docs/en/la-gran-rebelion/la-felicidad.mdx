People work daily, struggling to survive, wanting to exist in some way, but they are not happy. This thing called happiness is in Chinese - as they say around here - the worst thing is that people know it, but in the midst of so much bitterness, it seems they don't lose hope of achieving happiness one day, without knowing how or in what way.

Poor people! How they suffer! And yet, they want to live, they fear losing their lives.

If people understood something about revolutionary psychology, they might even think differently; but in truth, they know nothing, they want to survive in the midst of their misfortune and that is all.

There are pleasant and very enjoyable moments, but that is not happiness; people confuse pleasure with happiness.

"Pachanga", "Parranda", getting drunk, an orgy; it is bestial pleasure, but not happiness... However, there are healthy little parties without drunkenness, without bestialities, without alcohol, etc., but that is not happiness either...

Are you a kind person? How do you feel when you dance? Are you in love? Do you truly love? How do you feel dancing with the being you adore? Allow me to be a little cruel at this moment in telling you that this is not happiness either.

If you are already old, if these pleasures do not attract you, if they taste like cockroach; excuse me if I tell you that you would be different if you were young and full of illusions.

Anyway, say what you will, dance or don't dance, fall in love or don't fall in love, have or don't have that thing called money, you are not happy even if you think otherwise.

One spends their life looking for happiness everywhere and dies without having found it.

In Latin America, there are many who hope to win the lottery jackpot one day, they believe that this is how they will achieve happiness; some even really win it, but they do not achieve the long-awaited happiness.

When one is young, one dreams of the ideal woman, some princess from the "Arabian Nights", something extraordinary; then comes the harsh reality of the facts: wife, small children to support, difficult economic problems, etc.

There is no doubt that as children grow, problems also grow and even become impossible...

As the boy or girl grows, the shoes become larger and larger and the price higher, that is clear.

As the children grow, the clothes become more and more expensive; if there is money there is no problem in this, but if there is not, the thing is serious and one suffers horribly...

All this would be more or less bearable, if one had a good woman, but when the poor man is betrayed, "when he is cheated on", what good is it then to fight out there to get money?

Unfortunately, there are extraordinary cases, wonderful women, true companions both in opulence and in misfortune, but to top it all off, then the man does not know how to appreciate her and even abandons her for other women who are going to embitter his life.

Many are the maidens who dream of a "Prince Charming", unfortunately in truth, things turn out very differently and in the field of facts the poor woman marries an executioner...

The greatest illusion of a woman is to have a beautiful home and be a mother: "holy predestination", but even if the man turns out to be very good, which is certainly very difficult, in the end everything passes: the sons and daughters get married, leave or treat their parents badly and the home ends definitively.

In short, in this cruel world in which we live, there are no happy people... All poor human beings are unhappy.

In life we have known many donkeys loaded with money, full of problems, lawsuits of all kinds, overburdened with taxes, etc. They are not happy.

What good is it to be rich if you don't have good health? Poor rich people! Sometimes they are more miserable than any beggar.

Everything passes in this life: things pass, people pass, ideas pass, etc. Those who have money pass and those who do not have it also pass and no one knows authentic happiness.

Many want to escape from themselves through drugs or alcohol, but in truth they not only do not achieve such escape, but what is worse, they are trapped in the hell of vice.

The friends of alcohol or marijuana or "L.S.D.", etc., disappear as if by magic when the addict resolves to change his life.

Fleeing from the "Me Myself", from the "I Myself", happiness is not achieved. It would be interesting to "take the bull by the horns", observe the "I", study it with the purpose of discovering the causes of the pain.

When one discovers the true causes of so much misery and bitterness, it is obvious that something can be done...

If one manages to get rid of the "Me Myself", with "My Drunkenness", with "My Vices", with "My Affections", which cause me so much pain in my heart, with my worries that shatter my brains and make me sick, etc., etc., it is clear that then comes that which is not of time, that which is beyond the body, the affections and the mind, that which is really unknown to the understanding and that is called: HAPPINESS!

Unquestionably, while the conscience continues bottled up, stuffed between the "ME MYSELF", between the "I MYSELF", in no way will it be able to know legitimate happiness.

Happiness has a flavour that the "I MYSELF", the "ME MYSELF", has never ever known.
