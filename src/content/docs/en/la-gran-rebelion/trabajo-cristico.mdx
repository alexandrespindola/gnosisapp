The intimate Christ arises inwardly in the work related to the dissolution of the Psychological Ego.

Obviously, the inner Christ only comes at the culminating moment of our intentional efforts and voluntary sufferings.

The advent of the Christic fire is the most important event of our own life.

The intimate Christ then takes charge of all our mental, emotional, motor, instinctive and sexual processes.

Unquestionably, the intimate Christ is our deep inner saviour.

He, being perfect, would seem imperfect when he enters us; being chaste, he would seem not to be; being just, he would seem not to be.

This is similar to the different reflections of light. If you wear blue glasses, everything will seem blue to us, and if we wear red glasses, we will see everything in that colour.

Even though he is white, seen from the outside, each one will see him through the psychological lens with which he is viewed; that is why people see him, but do not see him.

By taking charge of all our psychological processes, the Lord of perfection suffers unspeakably.

Converted into a man among men, he must go through many trials and endure unspeakable temptations.

Temptation is fire, triumph over temptation is Light.

The initiate must learn to live dangerously; thus it is written; this is known by the Alchemists.

The initiate must walk firmly along the Razor's Edge; on either side of the difficult path there are terrifying abysses.

On the difficult path of the dissolution of the Ego, there are complex paths that have their root precisely in the royal road.

Obviously, from the path of the Razor's Edge spring multiple paths that lead nowhere; some of them lead us to the abyss and despair.

There are paths that could turn us into majesties of such and such zones of the universe, but that would in no way bring us back to the bosom of the Eternal Common Cosmic Father.

There are fascinating paths, of most holy appearance, ineffable, unfortunately they can only lead us to the submerged involution of the infernal worlds.

In the work of the dissolution of the Ego, we need to surrender completely to the Inner Christ.

Sometimes problems of difficult solution appear; suddenly; the road is lost in inexplicable labyrinths and it is not known where it continues; only absolute obedience to the Inner Christ and to the Father who is in secret can in such cases guide us wisely.

The Path of the Razor's Edge is full of dangers inside and out.

Conventional morality is of no use; morality is a slave to customs; of the time; of the place.

What was moral in past times is now immoral; what was moral in the Middle Ages in these modern times may be immoral. What is moral in one country is immoral in another country, etc.

In the work of the dissolution of the Ego, it happens that sometimes when we think we are doing very well, it turns out that we are doing very badly.

Changes are indispensable during esoteric advancement, but reactionary people remain bottled up in the past; they petrify in time and thunder and lightning against us as we make profound psychological advances and radical changes.

People do not resist the initiate's changes; they want him to continue petrified in multiple yesterdays.

Any change that the initiate makes is immediately classified as immoral.

Looking at things from this angle in the light of the Christic work, we can clearly see the ineffectiveness of the various codes of morality that have been written in the world.

Unquestionably, Christ manifested and yet hidden in the heart of the real man; by taking charge of our various psychological states, being unknown to people, is in fact qualified as cruel, immoral and perverse.

It is paradoxical that people adore Christ and yet attach such horrifying qualifications to him.

Obviously, unconscious and sleeping people only want a historical, anthropomorphic Christ, of statues and unbreakable dogmas, to whom they can easily accommodate all their codes of clumsy and rancid morality and all their prejudices and conditions.

People can never conceive of the Intimate Christ in the heart of man; the multitudes only adore the statue Christ and that is all.

When one speaks to the multitudes, when one declares to them the crude realism of the revolutionary Christ; of the red Christ, of the rebel Christ, immediately one receives qualifications such as the following: blasphemer, heretic, evil, profaner, sacrilegious, etc.

That is how the multitudes are, always unconscious; always asleep. Now we will understand why Christ crucified on Golgotha exclaims with all the strength of his soul: Father forgive them because they know not what they do!

Christ in himself being one, appears as many; that is why it has been said that he is perfect multiple unity. To him who knows, the word gives power; no one pronounced it, no one will pronounce it, but only he who HAS HIM INCARNATED.

Incarnating him is fundamental in the advanced work of the pluralized Ego.

The lord of perfection works in us as we consciously strive in the work on ourselves.

The work that the Intimate Christ has to do within our own psyche is appallingly painful.

In truth, our inner Master must live his entire Via Crucis in the very depths of our own soul.

It is written: "Pray to God and keep hammering". It is also written: "Help yourself and I will help you".

Supplicating the divine Mother Kundalini is fundamental when it comes to dissolving undesirable psychic aggregates, but the Intimate Christ in the deepest backgrounds of myself, operates wisely according to the own responsibilities that he throws on his shoulders.
