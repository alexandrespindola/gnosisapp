One of the most difficult problems of our time certainly comes down to the intricate labyrinth of theories.

Undoubtedly, in these times, pseudo-esoteric and pseudo-occultist schools have multiplied exorbitantly here, there, and everywhere.

The trade in souls, books, and theories is frightening; rare is the one who, among the cobweb of so many contradictory ideas, manages to truly find the secret path.

The most serious thing of all is intellectual fascination; there is a tendency to nourish oneself strictly intellectually with everything that comes to mind.

The vagabonds of the intellect are no longer content with all that subjective and general type of literature that abounds in the book markets, but now, to top it all off, they also gorge and become indigested with the cheap pseudo-esotericism and pseudo-occultism that abounds everywhere like weeds.

The result of all these jargons is the confusion and manifest disorientation of the rogues of the intellect.

I constantly receive letters and books of all kinds; the senders, as always, questioning me about this or that school, about such and such a book, I limit myself to answering the following: Leave mental idleness; the lives of others are none of your business, disintegrate the animal ego of curiosity, you should not care about other people's schools, become serious, know yourself, study yourself, observe yourself, etc., etc., etc.

Really, the important thing is to know oneself deeply at all levels of the mind.

Darkness is unconsciousness; light is consciousness; we must allow light to penetrate our darkness; obviously light has the power to overcome darkness.

Unfortunately, people find themselves self-locked within the fetid and filthy environment of their own minds, worshipping their beloved Ego.

People do not want to realise that they are not masters of their own lives, certainly each person is controlled from within by many other people, I want to refer emphatically to all that multiplicity of egos that we carry within.

Ostensibly, each of those egos puts in our mind what we should think, in our mouth what we should say, in our heart what we should feel, etc.

Under these conditions, the human personality is nothing more than a robot governed by different people who vie for supremacy and who aspire to supreme control of the capital centres of the organic machine.

In the name of truth, we must solemnly affirm that the poor intellectual animal mistakenly called man, even if he believes himself to be very balanced, lives in a complete psychological imbalance.

The intellectual mammal is in no way unilateral, if it were, it would be balanced.

The intellectual animal is unfortunately multilateral and that is demonstrated ad nauseam.

How could the rational humanoid be balanced? For perfect balance to exist, the awakened consciousness is needed.

Only the light of consciousness directed not from the angles but fully centrally upon ourselves, can end the contrasts, the psychological contradictions and establish in us the true inner equilibrium.

If we dissolve that whole set of egos that we carry within us, comes the awakening of consciousness and as a sequence or corollary the true balance of our own psyche.

Unfortunately, people do not want to realise the unconsciousness in which they live; they sleep deeply.

If people were awake, each one would feel their neighbours within themselves.

If people were awake, our neighbours would feel us within them.

Then obviously wars would not exist and the whole earth would truly be a paradise.

The light of consciousness, giving us true psychological balance, comes to establish each thing in its place, and what before entered into intimate conflict with us, in fact remains in its proper place.

Such is the unconsciousness of the multitudes that they are not even capable of finding the relationship between light and consciousness.

Unquestionably, light and consciousness are two aspects of the same thing; where there is light, there is consciousness.

Unconsciousness is darkness and the latter exists within us.

Only through psychological self-observation do we allow light to penetrate our own darkness.

"The light came into the darkness but the darkness did not understand it".
