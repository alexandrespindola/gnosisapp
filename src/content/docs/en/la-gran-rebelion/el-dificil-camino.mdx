Undoubtedly, there's a dark side to ourselves that we don't know or accept; we must bring the light of awareness to that shadowy aspect of ourselves.

The entire object of our Gnostic studies is to make self-knowledge more conscious.

When you have many things within yourself that you neither know nor accept, then such things complicate your life frightfully and truly provoke all sorts of situations that could be avoided through self-knowledge.

The worst thing about all this is that we project that unknown and unconscious side of ourselves onto other people, and then we see it in them.

For example: we see them as if they were liars, unfaithful, petty, etc., in relation to what we carry within.

Gnosis says on this particular point that we live in a very small part of ourselves.

This means that our consciousness extends only to a very small part of ourselves.

The idea of Gnostic esoteric work is to clearly expand our own consciousness.

Undeniably, as long as we are not well-related to ourselves, we will not be well-related to others either, and the result will be conflicts of all kinds.

It is essential to become much more aware of ourselves through direct self-observation.

A general Gnostic rule in Gnostic esoteric work is that when we do not get along with someone, you can be sure that this is the very thing against which it is necessary to work on oneself.

What is criticised so much in others is something that rests on the dark side of oneself and that is neither known nor wanted to be recognised.

When we are in such a condition, the dark side of ourselves is very large, but when the light of self-observation illuminates that dark side, consciousness increases through self-knowledge.

This is the Path of the Razor's Edge, more bitter than gall; many begin it, but very few reach the goal.

Just as the Moon has a hidden side that is not seen, an unknown side, so it is with the Psychological Moon that we carry within.

Obviously, such a Psychological Moon is formed by the Ego, the I, the Me Myself, the Self.

In this psychological moon we carry inhuman elements that frighten, that horrify, and that we would in no way accept having.

Cruel is this path of the INTIMATE SELF-REALISATION OF THE BEING! How many precipices! What difficult steps! What horrible labyrinths!

Sometimes the inner path, after many turns and twists, horrific climbs and very dangerous descents, is lost in deserts of sand; you do not know where it continues, and not a ray of light illuminates you.

A path full of dangers inside and out; a path of unspeakable mysteries, where only a breath of death blows.

On this inner path, when one believes that one is doing very well, in reality one is doing very badly.

On this inner path, when one believes that one is doing very badly, it turns out that one is doing very well.

On this secret path, there are moments when one no longer even knows what is good or what is bad.

What is normally forbidden sometimes turns out to be right; such is the inner path.

All moral codes on the inner path are superfluous; a beautiful maxim or a beautiful moral precept can, at certain moments, become a very serious obstacle to the intimate Self-Realisation of the Being.

Fortunately, the Intimate Christ from the very depths of our Being works intensively, suffers, weeps, disintegrates very dangerous elements that we carry within us.

The Christ is born as a child in the heart of man, but as he eliminates the undesirable elements that we carry inside, he grows little by little until he becomes a complete man.
