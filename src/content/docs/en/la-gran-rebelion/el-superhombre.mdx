A Code of Anahuac has said: "The Gods created men from wood and after creating them, fused them with divinity"; then adds: "Not all men manage to integrate with divinity".

Undoubtedly, the first thing needed is to create man before being able to integrate him with what is real.

The intellectual animal mistakenly called man is by no means man.

If we compare man with the intellectual animal, we can then verify for ourselves the concrete fact that the intellectual animal, although physically similar to man, is psychologically absolutely different.

Unfortunately, everyone thinks erroneously, assumes they are men, and qualifies as such.

We have always believed that man is the king of creation; the intellectual animal to date has not even demonstrated being king of himself; if he is not king of his own psychological processes, if he cannot direct them at will, much less will he be able to govern nature.

In no way could we accept man as a slave, incapable of governing himself and turned into a toy of the bestial forces of nature.

Either one is king of the universe or one is not; in the latter of these cases, the concrete fact of not yet having reached the state of man is unquestionably demonstrated.

Within the sexual glands of the intellectual animal, the sun has deposited the seeds for man.

Obviously, such seeds can develop or be definitively lost.

If we want such seeds to develop, it becomes indispensable to cooperate with the effort that the sun is making to create men.

The legitimate man must work intensively with the evident purpose of eliminating from himself the undesirable elements that we carry within.

If the real man does not eliminate such elements from himself, he would fail lamentably; he would become an abortion of the Cosmic Mother, a failure.

The man who truly works on himself with the purpose of awakening consciousness, will be able to integrate with the divine.

Ostensibly, the solar man integrated with divinity, becomes in fact and by right his own SUPER-MAN.

It is not so easy to reach the SUPER-MAN. Indubitably the path that leads to the SUPERMAN is beyond good and evil.

A thing is good when it suits us and bad when it does not suit us. Among the cadences of the verse, the crime is also hidden. There is much virtue in the wicked and much wickedness in the virtuous.

The path that leads to the SUPER-MAN is the Path of the Razor's Edge; this path is full of dangers inside and out.

Evil is dangerous, good is also dangerous; the frightful path is beyond good and evil, it is terribly cruel.

Any moral code can stop us in the march towards the SUPER-MAN. Attachment to such and such yesterdays, to such and such scenes can stop us on the road that reaches the SUPER-MAN.

The norms, the procedures, however wise they may be, if they are embroiled in such and such fanaticism, in such and such prejudice, in such and such concept, can hinder us in the advance towards the SUPER-MAN.

The SUPER-MAN knows the good of the bad and the bad of the good; he wields the sword of cosmic justice and is beyond good and evil.

The SUPER-MAN, having liquidated in himself all the good and bad values, has become something that no one understands, he is the ray, he is the flame of the universal spirit of life shining on the face of a Moses.

In each shop along the way, some hermit offers his gifts to the SUPER-MAN, but he continues his path beyond the good intentions of the hermits.

What the people said under the sacred portico of the temples has much beauty, but the SUPERMAN is beyond the pious sayings of the people.

The SUPER-MAN is the ray and his word is the thunder that disintegrates the powers of good and evil.

The SUPER-MAN shines in the darkness, but the darkness hates the SUPER-MAN.

The multitudes qualify the SUPER-MAN as perverse by the very fact that he does not fit within the indisputable dogmas, nor within the pious phrases, nor within the sound morals of serious men.

People abhor the SUPER-MAN and crucify him among criminals because they do not understand him, because they prejudge him, looking at him through the psychological lens of what is believed to be holy, even if it is evil.

The SUPER-MAN is like the spark that falls on the perverse or like the brilliance of something that is not understood and that is then lost in mystery.

The SUPER-MAN is neither holy nor perverse, he is beyond holiness and perversity; but people qualify him as holy or perverse.

The SUPER-MAN shines for a moment among the darkness of this world and then disappears forever.

Within the SUPER-MAN the Red Christ shines abrasively. The revolutionary Christ, the Lord of the Great Rebellion.
