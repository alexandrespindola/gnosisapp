The sparkling intellectualism as a manifest functionalism of the psychological self, is undoubtedly THE ANTICHRIST.

Those who suppose that the ANTICHRIST is a strange character born in such and such a place on earth or come from this or that country, are certainly completely wrong.

We have said emphatically that the ANTICHRIST is in no way a defined subject, but all subjects.

Obviously, the ANTICHRIST lies deep within each person and expresses itself in multiple forms.

The intellect placed at the service of the spirit is useful; the intellect divorced from the spirit becomes useless.

From intellectualism without spirituality arise scoundrels, a living manifestation of the ANTICHRIST.

Obviously, the scoundrel in and of itself is the ANTICHRIST. Unfortunately, the current world with all its tragedies and miseries is governed by the ANTICHRIST.

The chaotic state in which current humanity finds itself is undoubtedly due to the ANTICHRIST.

The iniquitous one that Paul of Tarsus spoke of in his epistles is certainly a crude reality of these times.

The iniquitous one has already come and manifests everywhere; he certainly has the gift of ubiquity.

He argues in caf√©s, makes deals at the UN, sits comfortably in Geneva, conducts laboratory experiments, invents atomic bombs, guided missiles, asphyxiating gases, bacteriological bombs, etc., etc., etc.

Fascinated by his own intellectualism, the absolute exclusivity of know-it-alls, the ANTICHRIST believes he knows all the phenomena of nature.

Believing himself to be omniscient, bottled up amongst all the rot of his theories, the ANTICHRIST flatly rejects anything that resembles God or is worshipped.

The self-sufficiency of the ANTICHRIST, the pride and arrogance he possesses, is unbearable.

The ANTICHRIST mortally hates the Christian virtues of faith, patience and humility.

Every knee bows before the ANTICHRIST. Obviously, he has invented supersonic planes, marvellous ships, gleaming automobiles, amazing medicines, etc.

Under these conditions, who could doubt the ANTICHRIST? Anyone who dares in these times to speak out against all these miracles and wonders of the son of perdition, condemns himself to the ridicule of his peers, to sarcasm, to irony, to the label of stupid and ignorant.

It is difficult to make serious and scholarly people understand this; they themselves react, they resist.

It is clear that the intellectual animal mistakenly called man is a robot programmed with kindergarten, primary, secondary, high school, university, etc.

No one can deny that a programmed robot functions according to the program; in no way could it function if it were taken out of the program.

The ANTICHRIST has developed the program with which the humanoid robots of these decadent times are programmed.

Making these clarifications, emphasising what I am saying, is frighteningly difficult because it is outside the program; no humanoid robot could admit things that are outside the program.

This issue is so serious and the entanglements of the mind so tremendous, that in no way would any humanoid robot remotely suspect that the program is useless, since he has been arranged according to the program, and doubting it would seem to him a heresy, something incongruous and absurd.

For a robot to doubt its program is an abomination, something absolutely impossible because its very existence is due to the program.

Unfortunately, things are not as the humanoid robot thinks; there is another science, another wisdom, unacceptable to the humanoid robot.

The humanoid robot reacts, and he is right to react because he has not been programmed for another science, nor for another culture, nor for anything different from his usual program.

The ANTICHRIST has developed the programs of the humanoid robot; the robot prostrates himself humbly before his master. How could the robot doubt the wisdom of his master?

The innocent and pure child is born; the essence expressing itself in each creature is precious in a great way.

Undoubtedly, nature deposits in the brains of newborns all those wild, natural, rustic, cosmic, spontaneous data, essential for the capture or apprehension of the truths contained in any natural phenomenon perceptible to the senses.

This means that the newborn child could by himself discover the reality of each natural phenomenon, unfortunately the ANTICHRIST's program interferes and the wonderful qualities that nature has deposited in the newborn's brain are soon destroyed.

The ANTICHRIST prohibits thinking differently; every creature that is born, by order of the ANTICHRIST, must be programmed.

There is no doubt that the ANTICHRIST mortally hates that precious sense of Being, known as the "faculty of instinctive perception of cosmic truths".

Pure science, different from all the rot of university theories that exist here, there and everywhere, is something inadmissible for the robots of the ANTICHRIST.

The ANTICHRIST has spread many wars, famines and diseases throughout the entire roundness of the earth, and there is no doubt that he will continue to spread them before the final catastrophe arrives.

Unfortunately, the hour of the great apostasy announced by all the prophets has arrived, and no human being would dare to speak out against the ANTICHRIST.
