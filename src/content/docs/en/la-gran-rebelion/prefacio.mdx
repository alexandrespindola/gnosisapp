FOREWORD
By: V.M. GARGHA KUICHINES

The "GREAT REBELLION" of the Venerable Master Samael Aun Weor palpably shows us our position in life.

We must break everything that ties us to the illusory things of this life.

Here we gather the teaching of each chapter to guide the courageous one who launches into the battle against himself.

All the keys in this work lead to the destruction of our Egos, to liberate the Essence, which is what is worthwhile in us.

The Ego does not want to die, and the owner feels inferior to the defect.

The world abounds with the incapable, and fear wreaks havoc everywhere.

"THERE ARE NO IMPOSSIBLE THINGS, WHAT THERE ARE ARE INCAPABLE MEN."

CHAPTER 1

Humanity is devoid of inner beauty; the superficial annuls everything. Piety is unknown. Cruelty has followers. Tranquillity does not exist because people live worried and desperate.

The fate of the afflicted is in the hands of sinners of all kinds.

CHAPTER 2

Hunger and despair increase from instant to instant, and chemical products destroy the Earth's atmosphere, but there is an antidote against the evil that surrounds us: "Scientific Chastity" or taking advantage of the human seed, transforming it into ENERGY in our human laboratory and then into Light and Fire when we learn to manage the 3 factors of awakening consciousness: 1. Death of our defects. 2. Forming the solar bodies within us. 3. Serving the Poor Orphan (Humanity).

Earth, water, and air are contaminated by the present civilisation; all the gold in the world is not enough to repair the damage; only the liquid gold that we all produce serves us, our own seed, using it wisely with knowledge of cause, thus enabling us to improve the world and serve with awakened consciousness.

We are forming the World Salvation Army with all those courageous ones who close ranks with the Avatar of Aquarius, through the Doctrine of Christification, which will free us from all evil.

If you improve yourself, the world improves.

CHAPTER 3

For many, happiness does not exist, they do not know that it is our work, that we are its architects, the builders; we build it with our liquid gold, our Seed.

When we are content, we feel happy, but those moments are fleeting; if you do not have command over your earthly mind, you will be a slave to it, because it is never content with anything. We must live in the World without being a Slave to it.

CHAPTER 4 SPEAKS ABOUT FREEDOM

Freedom fascinates us, we would like to be free, but we are spoken ill of someone and we are bewitched, and so we become libertines and become evil.

He who repeats malicious rumours is more perverse than he who invents them, because the latter may proceed out of jealousy, envy, or sincere error; the repeater does so as a faithful disciple of evil; he is an evil person in potential. "Seek the Truth and it shall set you free." But how can the liar reach the Truth? In those conditions, he moves further and further away from the opposite pole, The Truth.

The Truth is an attribute of the Well-Beloved Father, as is Faith. How can the liar have faith, if it is a gift from the Father? The gifts of the Father cannot be received by one who is full of defects, vices, lust for power, and arrogance. We are slaves to our own beliefs; flee from the Clairvoyant who speaks of what he sees internally; such a one sells Heaven and everything will be taken from him. "Who is free? Who has achieved the famous freedom? How many have emancipated themselves? Alas! Alas! Alas!" (Samael). He who lies can never be free because he is against the Well-Beloved, who is pure Truth.

CHAPTER 5 SPEAKS ABOUT THE LAW OF THE PENDULUM

Everything flows and reflows, rises and falls, goes and comes; but people are more interested in the comings and goings of their neighbour than in their own comings and goings, and so they walk in the stormy sea of their existence, using their defective senses to qualify the oscillation of their neighbour; and what about him? When man kills his egos or defects, he frees himself, he liberates himself from many mechanical laws, breaks one of the many shells we form, and feels a longing for freedom.

Extremes will always be harmful; we must seek the golden mean, the balance.

Reason bows reverently before the accomplished fact, and the concept vanishes before the crystalline truth. "Only by eliminating error does Truth come" (Samael).

CHAPTER 6 CONCEPT AND REALITY

It is convenient that the reader studies this chapter carefully to avoid being guided by erroneous assessments; as long as we have psychological defects, vices, manias, our concepts will also be erroneous; this of: "That is so because I verified it", is of fools, everything has facets, edges, undulations, ups and downs, distances, times, where the unilateral fool sees things in his own way, imposes them with violence, frightening his listeners.

CHAPTER 7 DIALECTICS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

We know, and this teaches us, that we can only awaken consciousness on the basis of conscious work and voluntary suffering.

The devotee of the Path wastes the ENERGY of the small percentage of consciousness when he identifies with the events of his existence.

A trained Master, participating in the Drama of Life, does not identify with that drama, he feels like a spectator in the circus of life; there, as in the cinema, the spectators take sides with the offender or with the offended. Master of Life is he who teaches good and useful things to the devotee of the path, makes them better than they are, Mother Nature obeys him, and people follow him with LOVE.

"Consciousness is Light that the unconscious does not perceive" (Samael Aun Weor) what happens to the sleeping person with the Light of Consciousness, is what happens to the blind person with the Light of the Sun.

When the radius of our consciousness increases, one experiences inwardly what is real, what is.

CHAPTER 8 SCIENTIFIC JARGON

People are frightened by the phenomena of nature and wait for them to pass; science labels them and gives them difficult names, so that the ignorant will not continue to bother them.

There are millions of beings who know the name of their ills, but do not know how to destroy them.

Man handles marvellously the complicated vehicles that he creates, but does not know how to handle his own vehicle: The body in which he moves from instant to instant; for man to know it, it happens to him, what happens to a laboratory with dirt or impurities; but man is told to clean it, killing his defects, habits, vices, etc., and he is not capable, he believes that a daily bath is enough.

CHAPTER 9 THE ANTICHRIST

We carry it within. It does not allow us to reach the Well-Beloved Father. But when we totally dominate it, it is multiple in its expression.

The Antichrist hates the Christian virtues of Faith, Patience, Humility, etc. "Man" worships his science and obeys it.

CHAPTER 10 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EGO

We must observe ourselves in action from instant to instant, to know if what we do improves us, because the destruction of others is of no use to us. It only leads us to the conviction that we are good destroyers, but this is good when we destroy in ourselves our evil, to improve ourselves in accordance with the living Christ that we carry in potential to illuminate and improve the Human species.

To teach to hate, that everyone knows, but to teach to LOVE, that is difficult.

Read carefully, dear reader, this chapter, if you wish to destroy your own evil at its root.

CHAPTERS 11 TO 20

People love to opine, to present others as they see them, but no one wants to know himself, which is what counts on the Path of Christification.

He who tells the most lies is in fashion; Light is consciousness, and when it manifests itself in us, it is to perform superior work. "By their works ye shall know them," said Jesus the Christ.

He did not say that by the attacks they made. Gnostics... awaken!!!

The intellective or emotive man acts according to his intellect or emotions. These, as judges, are terrible, they hear what suits them and judge or give as the truth of God, what a Liar greater than they affirms to them.

Where there is light, there is consciousness. Slander is the work of darkness, it does not come from the light.

Chapter 12 speaks about the 3 minds that we possess: Sensual Mind or of the senses, Intermediate Mind; this is the one that believes everything it hears and judges according to the offender or defender; when it is directed by the consciousness, it is a formidable mediator, it becomes an instrument of action; the things deposited in the intermediate mind form our beliefs.

He who has true faith does not need to believe; the liar cannot have faith, an attribute of God and direct experience, nor an inner mind, which we discover when we give Death to the undesirables that we carry in our Psyche.

The virtue of knowing our defects, then analysing them and later destroying them with the help of our mother RAM-IO, allows us to change and not be slaves of the tyrants that arise in all beliefs.

The Ego, the Ego, is disorder within us; only the Being has the power to establish order within us, in our Psyche.

From the detailed study of chapter 13, we realise what happens to the Defective Seer, when he meets the undesirable Egos of any little brother of the Path. When we self-observe we stop speaking ill of anyone.

The Being and the Knowing must balance each other; thus, comprehension is born. Knowing, without knowledge of the Being, brings intellectual confusion of all kinds; the rogue is born.

If the Being is greater than the Knowing, the stupid saint is born. Chapter 14 gives us formidable keys to self-knowledge; We are a divine God, with a retinue around us that does not belong to us; renouncing all that is liberation and let them say...

"The crime is dressed with the gown of Judge, with the tunic of the Master, with the garb of the beggar, with the suit of the Lord and even with the tunic of the Christ" (Samael).

Our Divine Mother Marah, Mary or RAM-IO as we gnostics call her, is the mediator between the Well-Beloved Father and us, the mediator between the elemental Gods of nature and the magician; through her and by means of her, the elementals of nature obey us. She is our Divine Deva, the mediator between the Blessed Mother Goddess of the world and our physical vehicle, to achieve amazing prodigies and serve our fellow men.

From the Sexual union with the Priestess wife, the man feminises himself and the wife masculinises herself; our Mother RAM-IO is the only one who can turn our Egos and their legions into cosmic dust. With the sensitive norms we cannot know the things of the Being, because the senses are dense instruments, loaded with defects, as is their owner; it is required to decongest them, killing in us defects, vices, manias, attachments, desires, and everything that pleases the earthly mind, which provides us with so many doubts.

In chapter 18 we see, according to the Law of duality, that just as we live in a country or place on earth, so also in our intimacy exists the psychological place where we are located.

Read, dear reader, this interesting chapter so that you know internally in what neighbourhood, district or place you are located.

When we use our divine Mother RAM-IO we destroy our satanic egos and liberate ourselves in the 96 laws of consciousness, from so much rottenness. Hatred does not let us progress internally.

The liar sins against his own Father and the fornicator against the Holy Spirit; one fornicates in thought, word, and deed.

There are tyrants who speak wonders of themselves, seduce many ignorant, but if their work is analysed, we find destruction and anarchy; life itself takes care of isolating them and forgetting them.

In chapter 19, it gives us lights so as not to fall into the illusion of feeling superior. We are all students in the service of the Avatar; the despot is hurt when he is hurt, and the fool, when he is not praised.

When we understand that the personality must be destroyed, if someone helps us in that hard work, it is to be appreciated.

Faith is pure knowledge, the direct experimental wisdom of the Being, "the hallucinations of the egoic consciousness are equal to the hallucinations caused by drugs" (Samael).

In chapter 20, it gives us keys to exterminate the lunar cold in the midst of which we develop and grow.

CHAPTERS FROM 21 TO 29

In 21 it speaks to us and teaches us to meditate and reflect, to know how to change. He who does not know how to meditate will never be able to dissolve the Ego.

In 22 it speaks to us about "RETURN AND RECURRENCE". The way it speaks to us about return is simple; if we do not want to repeat painful scenes, we must disintegrate the Egos that present them to us; we are taught to improve the quality of our children. Recurrence corresponds to the events of our existence, when we have a physical body.

The intimate Christ is the fire of fire; what we see and feel is the physical part of the Christic fire.

The advent of the Christic fire is the most important event of our own life; this fire takes charge of all the processes of our cylinders or brains, which we must first cleanse with the 5 elements of Nature, making use of the services of our Blessed Mother RAMIO.

"The Initiate must learn to live dangerously; thus, it is written".

In chapter 25, the Master speaks to us about the unknown side of ourselves, which we project as if we were a cinema projector, and then we see our defects on the alien screen.

All this shows us the sincere mistaken ones; just as our senses lie to us so we are liars; the hidden senses cause disasters when we awaken them without killing our defects.

In chapter 26 he speaks of the three traitors, the enemies of Hiram Abiff, the Internal Christ, the demons of: 1.- The mind 2.- Bad Will 3.- The desire

Each of us carries in our psyche the three traitors.

He teaches us that the Internal Christ, being purity and perfection, helps us to extirpate the thousands of undesirables that we carry within. In said chapter we are taught that the Secret Christ is the Lord of the GREAT REBELLION, rejected by the Priests, by the elders, and by the scribes of the temple.

In chapter 28, he speaks to us about the Super-Man and the total ignorance of the multitudes about him.

The Humanoid's efforts to become a Super-Man are battles and battles against himself, against the world, and against everything that treats this world of miseries.

In chapter 29, the final chapter, he speaks to us about the Holy Grail, the vase of Hermes, the cup of Solomon; the Holy Grail uniquely allegorizes the feminine Yoni, the sex, the soma of the mystics where the Holy Gods drink.

This cup of delight cannot be missing in any Temple of mysteries, nor in the life of the Gnostic Priest.

When the Gnostics understand this mystery, it will change their conjugal life, and the living altar will serve them to officiate as priests in the Divine Temple of Love.

May the deepest peace reign in your heart.

GARGHA KUICHINES.
