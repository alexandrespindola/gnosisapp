PREFACE

By: V.M. GARGHA KUICHINES

The "GREAT REBELLION" of the Venerable Master Samael Aun Weor palpably shows us our position in life.

We must break everything that binds us to the illusory things of this life.

Here we gather the teaching of each chapter to guide the brave one who launches into the battle against himself.

All the keys of this work lead to the destruction of our Egos, to free the Essence that is what is worthwhile in us.

The Ego does not want to die and the owner feels inferior to the defect.

In the world, incapable people abound and fear wreaks havoc everywhere.

"THERE ARE NO IMPOSSIBLE THINGS, WHAT THERE ARE ARE INCAPABLE MEN".

# CHAPTER 1

Humanity is devoid of inner beauty; the superficial annuls everything. Piety is unknown. Cruelty has followers. Tranquillity does not exist because people live worried and desperate.

The fate of the sufferers is in the hands of sinners of all kinds.

# CHAPTER 2

Hunger and despair increase from moment to moment and chemicals destroy the Earth's atmosphere, but there is an antidote to the evil that surrounds us: "Scientific Chastity" or taking advantage of the human seed, transforming it into ENERGY in our human laboratory and then into Light and Fire when we learn to manage the 3 factors of awakening of consciousness: 1. Death of our defects. 2. Forming the solar bodies within us. 3. Serving the Poor Orphan (Humanity).

Earth, water and air, are contaminated by the present civilisation; all the gold in the world is not enough to repair the evil; only the liquid gold that we all produce, our own seed, serves us, using it wisely with knowledge of cause, thus we are able to improve the world and serve with the awakened consciousness.

We are forming the World Salvation Army with all those brave men who close ranks with the Avatar of Aquarius, through the Doctrine of Christification that will free us from all evil.

If you improve yourself, the world improves.

# CHAPTER 3

For many, happiness does not exist, they do not know that it is our work, that we are its creators, the builders; we build it with our liquid gold, our Seed.

When we are happy we feel happy, but those moments are fleeting; if you have no control over your earthly mind, you will be its slave, because it is not content with anything. We must live in the World without being a Slave to it.

# CHAPTER 4 SPEAKS ABOUT FREEDOM

Freedom fascinates us, we would like to be free, but we are told bad things about someone and we become bewitched and thus we become libertines and become evil.

He who repeats the slanderous species, is more perverse than he who invents them, because this one may proceed out of jealousy, envy or sincere mistake; the repeater does it as a faithful disciple of evil, he is a potential evil. "Seek the Truth and it shall set you free". But how can the Liar reach the Truth? In those conditions, he moves further away from the opposite pole, The Truth, every moment.

Truth is an attribute of the Beloved Father, as is Faith. How can the liar have faith, if this is a gift from the Father? The gifts of the Father cannot be received by the one who is full of defects, vices, lust for power and arrogance. We are slaves to our own beliefs; flee from the Clairvoyant who speaks of what he sees internally; that one sells Heaven and everything will be taken from him.

"Who is free? Who has achieved the famous freedom? How many have been emancipated? Alas! Alas! Alas!" (Samael). He who lies can never be free because he is against the Beloved who is pure Truth.

# CHAPTER 5 SPEAKS ABOUT THE LAW OF THE PENDULUM

Everything flows and ebbs, rises and falls, goes and comes; but people are more interested in the comings and goings of their neighbour than their own comings and goings and thus he walks in the stormy sea of his existence, using his defective senses to qualify the oscillation of his neighbour; and what about him? When man kills his egos or defects he is liberated, he is freed from many mechanical laws, he breaks one of the many shells that we form and feels a longing for freedom.

Extremes will always be detrimental, we must seek the golden mean, the needle of the balance.

Reason bows reverently before the accomplished fact and the concept vanishes before the crystalline truth. "Only by eliminating error does Truth come" (Samael).

# CHAPTER 6 CONCEPT AND REALITY

It is convenient for the reader to study this chapter carefully to avoid being guided by erroneous appreciations; as long as we have psychological defects, vices, manias, our concepts will also be erroneous; this of: "It is so because I verified it", is of fools, everything has facets, edges, undulations, ups and downs, distances, times, where the unilateral fool sees things in his own way, imposes them with violence, frightening his listeners.

# CHAPTER 7 DIALECTICS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

We know and this teaches us, that we can only awaken the consciousness based on conscious work and voluntary sufferings.

The devotee of the Path wastes the ENERGY of the small percentage of consciousness when he identifies with the events of his existence.

A qualified Master, participating in the Drama of Life, does not identify with said drama, he feels like a spectator in the circus of life; there as in the cinema, the spectators take sides with the offender or with the offended. Master of Life is the one who teaches good and useful things to the devotee of the path, makes them better than they are, Mother Nature obeys him and people follow him with LOVE.

"Consciousness is Light that the unconscious does not perceive" (Samael Aun Weor) to the sleeping person it happens with the Light of Consciousness, what to the blind person with the Light of the Sun.

When the radius of our consciousness increases, one experiences inwardly the real, what is.

# CHAPTER 8 SCIENTIFIC JARGON

People are frightened by the phenomena of nature and wait for them to pass; science labels them and gives them difficult names, so that the ignorant do not continue to bother them.

There are millions of beings who know the name of their ills, but do not know how to destroy them.

Man handles wonderfully the complicated vehicles that he creates, but he does not know how to handle his own vehicle: The body in which he moves from moment to moment; for man to know it, it happens to him, as to a laboratory with dirt or impurities; but man is told to clean it, killing his defects, habits, vices, etc., and he is not capable, he believes that with the daily bath is enough.

# CHAPTER 9 THE ANTICHRIST

We carry it inside. He does not allow us to reach the Beloved Father. But when we dominate him completely he is multiple in his expression.

The Antichrist hates the Christian virtues of Faith, Patience, Humility, etc. The "Man" adores his science and obeys it.

# CHAPTER 10 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EGO

We must observe ourselves in action from moment to moment, to know if what we do improves us, because the destruction of others is of no use to us. It only leads us to the conviction that we are good destroyers, but this is good when we destroy in ourselves our evil, to improve ourselves according to the living Christ that we carry in potential to illuminate and improve the Human species.

Teaching to hate, that everyone knows, but teaching to LOVE, that is difficult.

Read carefully dear reader this chapter, if you want to destroy your own evil from the root.

# CHAPTERS 11 TO 20

People love to give their opinion, to present others as they see them, but nobody wants to know themselves, which is what counts on the Path of Christification.

He who tells more lies is in fashion; Light is consciousness and when it manifests in us, it is to execute superior work. "By their works you shall know them," said Jesus the Christ.

He did not say that by the attacks they made. Gnostics... wake up!!!

The intellectual or emotional man acts according to his intellect or emotions. These as judges are terrible, they hear what suits them and judge or give as truth of God, what a Liar greater than them affirms.

Where there is light, there is consciousness. Slander is the work of darkness, it does not come from the light.

Chapter 12 speaks of the 3 minds that we possess: Sensual Mind or of the senses, Intermediate Mind; this is the one that believes everything it hears and judges according to the offender or defender; when it is directed by the consciousness, it is a formidable mediator, it becomes an instrument of action; the things deposited in the intermediate mind form our beliefs.

He who has true faith does not need to believe; the liar cannot have faith, attribute of God and direct experience, nor inner mind, which we discover when we give Death to the undesirable ones that we carry in our Psyche.

The virtue of knowing our defects, then analysing them and later destroying them with the help of our mother RAM-IO, allows us to change and not be slaves of the petty tyrants that arise in all beliefs.

The Ego, the I, is disorder within us; only the Being has the power to establish order within us, in our Psyche.

From the careful study of chapter 13, we realise what happens to the Defective Seer, when he encounters the undesirable Egos of any little brother of the Path. When we self-observe we stop speaking badly of someone.

The Being and the Knowing, must balance each other; thus comprehension is born. Knowing, without knowledge of the Being, brings intellectual confusion of all kinds; the rogue is born.

If the Being is greater than the Knowing, the stupid saint is born. Chapter 14 gives us formidable keys to self-knowledge; We are a divine God, with a retinue around him that does not belong to him; renouncing all that is liberation and let them say...

"Crime dresses in the robe of a Judge, in the tunic of a Master, in the garb of a beggar, in the suit of a Lord and even in the tunic of a Christ" (Samael).

Our Divine Mother Marah, Mary or RAM-IO as we Gnostics call her, is the mediator between the Beloved Father and us, the mediator between the elemental Gods of nature and the magician; through her and by means of her, the elementals of nature obey us. She is our Divine Deva, the mediator between the Blessed Mother Goddess of the world and our physical vehicle, to achieve amazing prodigies and serve our fellow men.

From the Sexual union with the Priestess wife, the male becomes feminised and the wife becomes masculinised; our Mother RAM-IO is the only one that can turn our Egos and their legions into cosmic dust. With the sensitive norms we cannot know the things of the Being, because the senses are dense instruments, loaded with defects, as is their owner; it is required to decongest them, killing in us defects, vices, manias, attachments, desires, and everything that the earthly mind likes, which provides us with so many doubts.

In chapter 18 we see, according to the Law of duality, that just as we live in a country or place on earth, so also in our intimacy there is the psychological place where we are located. Read dear reader this interesting chapter so that you know internally in which neighbourhood, colony or place you are located.

When we use our divine Mother RAM-IO we destroy our satanic egos and we are liberated in the 96 laws of consciousness, from so much rottenness. Hatred does not allow us to progress internally.

The liar sins against his own Father and the fornicator against the Holy Spirit; he fornicates in thought, word and deed.

There are petty tyrants who speak wonders of themselves, seduce many ignorant people, but if their work is analysed, we find destruction and anarchy; life itself takes care of isolating and forgetting them.

In chapter 19, he gives us lights not to fall into the illusion of feeling superior. We are all students at the service of the Avatar; the despot is hurt when he is hurt and the fool, when he is not praised. When we understand that the personality must be destroyed, if someone helps us in that hard work it is to be thanked.

Faith is pure knowledge, the direct experimental wisdom of the Being, "the hallucinations of the egoic consciousness are equal to the hallucinations provoked by drugs" (Samael).

In chapter 20, he gives us keys to exterminate the lunar cold in the midst of which we unfold and develop.

# CHAPTERS 21 TO 29

In 21 he speaks and teaches us to meditate and reflect, to know how to change. He who does not know how to meditate can never dissolve the Ego.

In 22 he speaks to us about "RETURN AND RECURRENCE". The way he talks about return is simple; if we do not want to repeat painful scenes, we must disintegrate the Egos, which present them to us; we are taught to improve the quality of our children. Recurrence corresponds to the events of our existence, when we have a physical body.

The intimate Christ is the fire of fire; what we see and feel is the physical part of the Christic fire. The advent of the Christic fire is the most important event of our own life, this fire takes charge of all the processes of our cylinders or brains, which we must first clean with the 5 elements of Nature, making use of the services of our Blessed Mother RAMIO.

"The Initiate must learn to live dangerously; thus it is written".

In chapter 25, the Master tells us about the unknown side of ourselves, which we project as if we were a film projector, and then, we see our defects on the screen of others.

All this shows us the sincere mistaken ones; just as our senses lie to us so we are liars; the hidden senses cause disasters when we awaken them without killing our defects.

In chapter 26 he tells us about the three traitors, the enemies of Hiram Abiff, the Internal Christ, the demons of: 1.- The mind 2.- Bad Will 3.- The desire

Each of us carries in our psyche the three traitors.

He teaches us that the Internal Christ being purity and perfection, helps us to extirpate the thousands of undesirable that we carry inside. In said chapter we are taught that the Secret Christ is the Lord of the GREAT REBELLION, rejected by the Priests, by the elders and by the scribes of the temple.

In chapter 28, he tells us about the Super-Man and the total ignorance of the multitudes about him.

The efforts of the Humanoid to become a Super-Man are battles and battles against himself, against the world and against everything that treats this world of miseries.

In chapter 29, final chapter, he tells us about the Holy Grail, the vessel of Hermes, the cup of Solomon; the Holy Grail allegorises in a unique way the feminine Yoni, the sex, the soma of the mystics where the Holy Gods drink.

This cup of delight cannot be missing in any Temple of mysteries, nor in the life of the Gnostic Priest.

When the gnostics understand this mystery, their conjugal life will change and the living altar will serve them to officiate as a priest in the Divine Temple of Love.

May the deepest peace reign in your heart.
