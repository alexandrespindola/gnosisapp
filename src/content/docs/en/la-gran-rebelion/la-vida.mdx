Incredible as it may seem, it is very true and completely factual that this much-vaunted modern civilisation is frightfully ugly, it does not possess the transcendental characteristics of aesthetic sense, it is devoid of inner beauty.

We boast a lot about those horrifying, same-old buildings, which look like veritable rat traps.

The world has become terribly boring, the same old streets and horrifying houses everywhere.

All this has become tiresome, in the North and in the South, in the East and in the West of the World.

It's the same old uniform: horrifying, nauseating, sterile. "Modernism!" the multitudes exclaim.

We seem like veritable vain peacocks with the suit we wear and with very shiny shoes, even though millions of unhappy, hungry, malnourished, miserable people circulate here, there and everywhere.

Simplicity and natural, spontaneous, naive beauty, devoid of artifice and vain paintings, has disappeared in the Female Sex. Now we are modern, that's life.

People have become frightfully cruel: charity has caught a cold, nobody has pity on anyone anymore.

The windows or displays of luxury stores shine with luxurious merchandise that is definitely beyond the reach of the unfortunate.

The only thing the Outcasts of life can do is contemplate silks and jewels, perfumes in luxurious bottles and umbrellas for the downpours; see without being able to touch, a torment similar to that of Tantalus.

The people of these modern times have become too rude: the perfume of friendship and the fragrance of sincerity have radically disappeared.

The crowds groan, overburdened with taxes; everyone is in trouble, we are owed and we owe; we are sued and we have nothing to pay with, worries shatter brains, nobody lives in peace.

The bureaucrats with the curve of happiness in their bellies and a good cigar in their mouths, on which they psychologically lean, juggle political balls with the mind without giving a damn about the pain of the people.

Nobody is happy these days, least of all the middle class, it is caught between a rock and a hard place.

Rich and poor, believers and disbelievers, merchants and beggars, shoemakers and tinsmiths, live because they have to live, drown their tortures in wine and even become drug addicts to escape themselves.

People have become malicious, suspicious, distrustful, cunning, perverse; nobody believes in anyone anymore; new conditions, certificates, restrictions of all kinds, documents, credentials, etc., are invented daily, and in any case, none of that works anymore, the cunning make fun of all this nonsense: they don't pay, they evade the law even if they have to go to jail.

No job gives happiness; the sense of true love has been lost and people get married today and divorced tomorrow.

The unity of homes has been lamentably lost, organic shame no longer exists, lesbianism and homosexuality have become more common than washing hands.

Knowing something about all this, trying to know the cause of so much rot, inquiring, searching, is certainly what we propose in this book.

I am speaking in the language of practical life, eager to know what is hidden behind that horrifying mask of existence.

I am thinking out loud and let the rogues of intellect say what they please.

Theories have become tiresome and are even bought and sold in the market. So what?

Theories only serve to cause us worries and make our lives more bitter.

Goethe rightly said: "All theory is grey, and only the golden tree of life springs green."...

The poor people are already tired of so many theories, now there is much talk about practicalism, we need to be practical and really know the causes of our sufferings.
