We have reached a very thorny point; I want to refer to this question of Kundalini, the fiery serpent of our magical powers, cited in many texts of Eastern wisdom.

Undoubtedly, Kundalini has a lot of documentation and is something well worth investigating.

In the texts of Medieval Alchemy, Kundalini is the astral signature of the sacred sperm, STELLA MARIS, the VIRGIN OF THE SEA, who wisely guides the workers of the Great Work.

Among the Aztecs she is TONANTZIN, among the Greeks the CHASTE DIANA, and in Egypt she is ISIS, the DIVINE MOTHER whose veil no mortal has lifted.

There is no doubt that Esoteric Christianity never ceased to worship the Divine Mother Kundalini; obviously, she is MARAH, or better said RAM-IO, MARIA.

What the orthodox religions did not specify, at least as far as the exoteric or public circle is concerned, is the aspect of ISIS in her individual human form.

Ostensibly, it was only in secret that initiates were taught that this Divine Mother exists individually within each human being.

It is worth clarifying emphatically that God-Mother, RHEA, CYBELE, ADONIA, or whatever we want to call her, is a variant of our own individual Being here and now.

In concrete terms, we will say that each of us has his or her own particular, individual Divine Mother.

There are as many Mothers in heaven as there are creatures on the face of the earth.

Kundalini is the mysterious energy that makes the world exist, an aspect of BRAHMA.

In its psychological aspect manifested in the hidden anatomy of the human being, the KUNDALINI is coiled three and a half times within a certain magnetic centre located in the coccygeal bone.

There she rests numb like any serpent, the Divine Princess.

In the centre of that Chakra or dwelling there is a female triangle or YONI where a male LINGAM is established.

In this atomic or magical LINGAM that represents the sexual creative power of BRAHMA, the sublime KUNDALINI serpent is coiled.

The fiery queen in her figure of a serpent, awakens with the secretum secretorum of a certain alchemist artifice that I have clearly taught in my work entitled: "The Mystery of the Golden Flower".

Unquestionably, when this divine force awakens, it ascends victoriously through the spinal medullary canal to develop in us the powers that divinise.

In its transcendental, divine, subliminal aspect, the sacred serpent transcending the merely physiological, anatomical, in its ethnic state, is, as I said, our own Being, but derived.

It is not my purpose to teach in this treatise the technique for the awakening of the sacred serpent.

I only want to put some emphasis on the crude realism of the Ego and the inner urgency related to the dissolution of its various inhuman elements.

The mind by itself cannot radically alter any psychological defect.

The mind can label any defect, move it from one level to another, hide it from itself or others, excuse it but never eliminate it absolutely.

Understanding is a fundamental part, but it is not everything; elimination is needed.

Observed defect must be analysed and understood in an integral way before proceeding to its elimination.

We need a power superior to the mind, a power capable of atomically disintegrating any I-defect that we have previously discovered and deeply judged.

Fortunately, such power underlies deeply beyond the body, affections and mind, although it has its concrete exponents in the bone of the coccygeal centre, as we already explained in previous paragraphs of the present chapter.

After having fully understood any I-defect, we must immerse ourselves in deep meditation, supplicating, praying, asking our particular individual Divine Mother to disintegrate the I-defect previously understood.

This is the precise technique that is required for the elimination of the undesirable elements that we carry within us.

The Divine Mother Kundalini has the power to reduce to ashes any subjective, inhuman psychic aggregate.

Without this didactic, without this procedure, all effort for the dissolution of the Ego is fruitless, useless, absurd.
