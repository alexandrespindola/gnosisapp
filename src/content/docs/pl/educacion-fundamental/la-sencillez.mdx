It is urgent and indispensable to develop creative understanding because it brings true freedom of living to the human being. Without understanding, it is impossible to achieve the authentic critical faculty of profound analysis.

Teachers in schools, colleges, and universities must guide their students along the path of self-critical understanding.

In our previous chapter, we extensively studied the processes of envy, and if we want to eliminate all the nuances of jealousy, whether religious, passionate, etc., we must become fully aware of what envy really is, because only by understanding the infinite processes of envy deeply and intimately can we end jealousy of all kinds.

Jealousy destroys marriages, jealousy destroys friendships, jealousy provokes religious wars, fratricidal hatreds, murders, and suffering of all kinds.

Envy, with all its infinite nuances, hides behind sublime purposes. Envy exists in the one who, having been informed about the existence of sublime saints, Mahatmas, or Gurus, also wishes to become a saint. Envy exists in the philanthropist who strives to surpass other philanthropists. Envy exists in every individual who covets virtues because they have information, because in their mind there is data about the existence of sacred individuals full of virtues.

The desire to be a saint, the desire to be virtuous, the desire to be great is based on envy.

Saints with their virtues have caused much harm. We are reminded of the case of a man who considered himself very holy.

On one occasion, a hungry and miserable poet knocked on his doors to place in his hands a beautiful verse especially dedicated to the saint of our story. The poet only awaited a coin to buy food for his exhausted and aging body.

The poet imagined everything but an insult. Great was his surprise when the saint, with a pious look and a furrowed brow, closed the door, saying to the unhappy poet: "Get out of here, friend, away, away... I don't like these things, I abhor flattery... I don't like the vanities of the world, this life is an illusion... I follow the path of humility and modesty." The unhappy poet, who only wanted a coin, instead received the insult of the saint, the word that hurts, the slap, and with a saddened heart and the lyre turned to pieces, he went through the streets of the city slowly... slowly... slowly.

The new generation must rise on the basis of authentic understanding because it is totally creative.

Memory and recollection are not creative. Memory is the tomb of the past. Memory and recollection are death.

True understanding is the psychological factor of total liberation.

The memories of memory can never bring us true liberation because they belong to the past and are therefore dead.

Understanding is not a thing of the past nor of the future. Understanding belongs to the moment we are living here and now. Memory always brings the idea of the future.

It is urgent to study science, philosophy, art, and religion, but studies should not be entrusted to the fidelity of memory because it is not faithful.

It is absurd to deposit knowledge in the tomb of memory. It is stupid to bury in the pit of the past the knowledge that we must understand.

We could never pronounce ourselves against study, against wisdom, against science, but it is incongruous to deposit the living jewels of knowledge in the corrupted tomb of memory.

It is necessary to study, it is necessary to investigate, it is necessary to analyze, but we must meditate deeply to understand at all levels of the mind.

The truly simple man is deeply understanding and has a simple mind.

The important thing in life is not what we have accumulated in the tomb of memory, but what we have understood not only on the intellectual level but also in the different subconscious and unconscious terrains of the mind.

Science, knowledge, must become immediate understanding. When knowledge, when study has been transformed into authentic creative understanding, we can then understand all things immediately because understanding becomes immediate, instantaneous.

In the simple man, there are no complications in the mind because all complication of the mind is due to memory. The Machiavellian EGO that we carry within is accumulated memory.

The experiences of life must be transformed into true understanding.

When experiences do not become understanding, when experiences continue in memory, they constitute the rot of the tomb on which the fatuous and Luciferian flame of the intellect burns.

It is necessary to know that the animal intellect, totally devoid of all spirituality, is only the verbalization of memory, the sepulchral candle burning on the funeral slab.

The simple man has a mind free of experiences because these have become consciousness, have been transformed into creative understanding.

Death and life are intimately associated. Only by dying does the grain give birth to the plant, only by dying does experience give birth to understanding. This is a process of authentic transformation.

The complicated man has a memory full of experiences.

This demonstrates his lack of creative understanding because when experiences are entirely understood at all levels of the mind, they cease to exist as experiences and are born as understanding.

It is necessary to first experience, but we must not remain in the terrain of experience because then the mind becomes complicated and difficult. It is necessary to live life intensely and transform all experiences into authentic creative understanding.

Those who mistakenly suppose that in order to be understanding, simple, and uncomplicated, we have to abandon the world, become beggars, live in isolated huts, and wear loincloths instead of elegant suits, are totally mistaken.

Many anchorites, many solitary hermits, many beggars, have extremely complicated and difficult minds.

It is useless to withdraw from the world and live as anchorites if the memory is full of experiences that condition the free flow of thought.

It is useless to live as hermits, wanting to lead the life of saints, if the memory is filled with information that has not been properly understood, that has not become conscious in the different nooks, corridors, and unconscious regions of the mind.

Those who transform intellectual information into true creative understanding, those who transform the experiences of life into true deep understanding have nothing in memory, live from moment to moment full of true fullness, have become simple and uncomplicated even though they live in sumptuous residences and within the perimeter of urban life.

Small children before the age of seven are full of simplicity and true inner beauty because only the living ESSENCE of life expresses itself through them in the total absence of the PSYCHOLOGICAL EGO.

We must regain the lost childhood, in our heart and in our mind. We must regain innocence if we truly want to be happy.

Experiences and study transformed into deep understanding leave no residue in the tomb of memory and then, we become simple, uncomplicated, innocent, happy.

Deep meditation on the experiences and knowledge acquired, deep self-criticism, intimate psychoanalysis convert, transform everything into deep creative understanding. This is the path of authentic happiness born of wisdom and love.
