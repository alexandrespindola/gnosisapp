Through experience, we've found that it's impossible to understand THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE until we've comprehensively understood the complex problem of the MIND.

Those who assume that the MIND is the BRAIN are completely mistaken. The MIND is ENERGETIC, subtle, and can become independent of MATTER. It can, in certain hypnotic states or during normal sleep, transport itself to very remote locations to see and hear what is happening in those places.

Remarkable experiments are conducted in PARAPSYCHOLOGY laboratories with subjects in a HYPNOTIC state.

Many subjects in a HYPNOTIC state have been able to report in detail about events, people, and situations that were happening at remote distances during their hypnotic trance.

Scientists have been able to verify the reality of this INFORMATION after these experiments. They have been able to confirm the reality of the facts, the accuracy of the EVENTS.

With these experiments from PARAPSYCHOLOGY laboratories, it is fully demonstrated by observation and experience that the BRAIN is not the MIND.

We can truly say that the mind can travel through time and space, independently of the brain, to see and hear things that are happening in distant places.

The REALITY of EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTIONS is now ABSOLUTELY proven, and only a madman or an idiot could deny the reality of EXTRA PERCEPTIONS.

The brain is made to elaborate thought but is not thought itself. The brain is merely the instrument of the MIND, not the mind.

We need to study the mind in depth if we truly want to know THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE comprehensively.

Children and young people, male and female, have more elastic, ductile, quick, and alert minds.

Many children and young people enjoy asking their parents and teachers about certain things. They want to know more; they want to know and that is why they ask, observe, and see certain details that adults despise or do not perceive.

As the years go by, as we advance in age, the mind gradually crystallizes.

The minds of the elderly are fixed, petrified; they no longer change, even with a cannon.

The old are already that way, and that is how they die; they do not change, they approach everything from a fixed point.

The "SENILITY" of the elderly, their prejudices, fixed ideas, etc., all together seem like a ROCK, a STONE that does not change in any way. That is why the popular saying goes, "A LEOPARD CAN'T CHANGE ITS SPOTS."

It is URGENT that the teachers in charge of forming the PERSONALITY of students study the mind in depth so that they can guide the new generations intelligently.

It is painful to understand in depth how the MIND gradually petrifies over time.

The MIND is the killer of the REAL, of the true. The MIND destroys LOVE.

Someone who grows old is no longer capable of LOVE because their mind is full of painful experiences, prejudices, and fixed ideas like steel tips, etc.

There are old perverts out there who believe they are still capable of LOVE, but what happens is that these old men are full of senile sexual passions and confuse PASSION with LOVE.

Every "DIRTY OLD MAN" and "DIRTY OLD WOMAN" go through tremendous lustful, passionate states before dying, and they believe that is LOVE.

The LOVE of the elderly is impossible because the mind destroys it with its "SENILITY," "FIXED IDEAS," "PREJUDICES," "JEALOUSY," "EXPERIENCES," "MEMORIES," sexual passions, etc. etc. etc.

The MIND is the worst enemy of LOVE. In SUPERCIVILIZED countries, LOVE no longer exists because the minds of the people only smell of factories, bank accounts, gasoline, and celluloid.

There are many bottles for the mind, and the mind of each person is very well bottled.

Some have the MIND bottled in ABOMINABLE COMMUNISM, others have it bottled in ruthless CAPITALISM.

There are those who have the MIND BOTTLED in jealousy, in hatred, in the desire to be rich, in good social standing, in pessimism, in attachment to certain people, in attachment to their own sufferings, in their family problems, etc. etc. etc.

People love to bottle up the MIND. Rare are those who truly resolve to shatter the bottle.

We need to LIBERATE THE MIND, but people like slavery. It is very rare to find someone in life who does not have their MIND well bottled.

Teachers should teach their students all these things. They must teach the new generations to investigate their own minds, to observe them, to understand them. Only in this way, through in-depth UNDERSTANDING, can we prevent the mind from crystallizing, freezing, and being bottled up.

The only thing that can transform the world is THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE, but the mind destroys LOVE.

We need to STUDY our own minds, observe them, investigate them deeply, and truly understand them. Only in this way, only by becoming masters of ourselves, of our own minds, will we kill the killer of LOVE and be truly happy.

Those who live fantasizing beautifully about LOVE, those who live making plans about LOVE, those who want LOVE to operate according to their tastes and dislikes, plans and fantasies, norms and prejudices, memories and experiences, etc., will never really know what LOVE is. In fact, they have become enemies of LOVE.

It is necessary to comprehensively understand what the processes of the mind are in a state of accumulating experiences.

The teacher often scolds justly but sometimes stupidly and without true reason, without understanding that every unfair scolding is deposited in the minds of the students. The result of such a mistaken procedure is usually the loss of LOVE for the TEACHER.

The MIND destroys LOVE, and this is something that TEACHERS of schools, colleges, and universities should never forget.

It is necessary to understand in depth all those mental processes that end the beauty of LOVE.

It is not enough to be a father or mother; you have to know how to LOVE. Fathers and mothers believe that they love their sons and daughters because they have them, because they are theirs, because they possess them, like someone who has a bicycle, a car, a house.

That sense of possession and dependence is often confused with LOVE, but it could never be LOVE.

The teachers of our second home, which is school, believe that they love their disciples because they belong to them as such, because they possess them, but that is not LOVE. The sense of possession or dependence IS NOT LOVE.

The MIND destroys LOVE, and only by understanding all the mistaken functionalisms of the mind, our absurd way of thinking, our bad habits, automatic, mechanistic habits, a mistaken way of seeing things, etc., can we experience TRULY THAT WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO TIME, THAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE.

Those who want LOVE to become a piece of their own routine machine, those who want LOVE to walk along the wrong tracks of their own prejudices, appetites, fears, experiences of life, an egoistic way of seeing things, a mistaken way of thinking, etc., end up in fact with LOVE because it never allows itself to be subdued.

Those who want LOVE to function as I WANT, as I DESIRE, as I THINK, lose LOVE because CUPID, the GOD of LOVE, is never willing to be enslaved by the I.

You have to end the I, with MYSELF, with the SELF, so as not to lose the child of LOVE.

The I is a bunch of memories, appetites, fears, hatreds, passions, experiences, selfishness, envies, greed, lust, etc. etc. etc.

Only by understanding each defect separately, only by studying it, observing it directly not only in the intellectual region but also in all the subconscious levels of the mind, does each defect disappear, do we die from moment to moment. Thus, and only thus, do we achieve the disintegration of the I.

Those who want to bottle up LOVE inside the horrible bottle of the I lose LOVE; they are left without it because LOVE can never be bottled.

Unfortunately, people want LOVE to behave according to their own habits, desires, customs, etc. People want LOVE to submit to the I, and that is completely impossible because LOVE does not obey the I.

Couples in love, or rather passionate, which is what abounds most in this World, assume that LOVE must march faithfully along the tracks of their own desires, concupiscences, errors, etc., and in this, they are completely mistaken.

"Let's talk about the two of us!" say lovers or the sexually passionate, which is what abounds most in this World, and then come the talks, the projects, the yearnings, and sighs. Each one says something, exposes their projects, their desires, their way of seeing the things of life, and wants LOVE to move like a railroad machine along the steel tracks traced by the mind.

How wrong are those Lovers or passionate people! How far they are from reality.

LOVE does not obey the I, and when spouses want to put chains around its neck and subdue it, it flees, leaving the couple in disgrace.

The MIND has the bad taste of comparing. The man compares one girlfriend with another. The woman compares one man with another. The Teacher compares one student with another, as if all his students did not deserve the same appreciation. Really, all comparison is ABOMINABLE.

Someone who contemplates a beautiful sunset and compares it with another does not really know how to understand the beauty that is before his eyes.

Someone who contemplates a beautiful mountain and compares it with another that he saw yesterday is not really understanding the beauty of the mountain that is before his eyes.

Where COMPARISON exists, TRUE LOVE does not exist. The Father and Mother who truly love their children never compare them with anyone; they love them, and that is all.

The husband who truly loves his wife never makes the mistake of comparing her with anyone; he loves her, and that is all.

The TEACHER who loves their students never discriminates against them; they never compare them with each other; they truly love them, and that is all.

The Mind Divided by comparisons, the mind enslaved by DUALISM, destroys LOVE.

The Mind divided by the battling of opposites is not capable of understanding the new; it petrifies, it freezes.

The MIND HAS MANY DEPTHS, regions, subconscious terrains, nooks, but the best is the ESSENCE, the CONSCIOUSNESS, and it is in the Center.

When DUALISM ends, when the mind becomes INTEGRAL, SERENE, QUIET, DEEP, when it no longer compares, then the ESSENCE, the CONSCIOUSNESS awakens, and that must be the true objective of FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION.

Let us distinguish between OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE. In the OBJECTIVE, there is awakened consciousness. In the SUBJECTIVE, there is asleep Consciousness, SUBCONSCIOUSNESS.

Only OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS can enjoy OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.

The intellectual information that Students currently receive from all Schools, Colleges, and Universities is one hundred percent SUBJECTIVE.

OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE cannot be acquired without OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

Students must first reach SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS and then OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

Only by the PATH OF LOVE can we reach OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS and OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE.

It is necessary to understand the COMPLEX PROBLEM OF THE MIND if we truly want to travel the PATH OF LOVE.
