To remember is to try to store in the mind what we have seen and heard, what we have read, what other people have told us, what has happened to us, etc.

Teachers want their students to store their words in their memory, their phrases, what is written in school textbooks, entire chapters, overwhelming tasks, with all their periods and commas, etc.

Taking exams means recalling what we have been told, what we have read mechanically, verbalizing memory, repeating like parrots, everything we have stored in our memory.

It is necessary for the new generation to understand that repeating like a record player all the recordings made in memory does not mean having understood thoroughly. Remembering is not understanding; it is useless to remember without understanding. Memory belongs to the past; it is something dead, something that no longer has life.

It is indispensable, urgent, and of pressing importance that all students in schools, colleges, and universities truly understand the deep meaning of profound comprehension.

TO COMPREHEND is something immediate, direct, something we experience intensely, something we experience very deeply and that inevitably becomes the true inner SPRING of conscious action.

To remember, to recall, is something dead, belongs to the past, and unfortunately becomes an ideal, a motto, an idea, an idealism that we want to imitate mechanically and follow unconsciously.

In TRUE COMPREHENSION, in profound understanding, in the intimate understanding of the essence, there is only the inner pressure of consciousness, a constant pressure born from the essence we carry within, and that is all.

Authentic comprehension manifests as spontaneous, natural, simple action, free from the depressing process of choice; pure without indecision of any kind. COMPREHENSION converted into the SECRET SPRING of action is formidable, wonderful, edifying, and essentially dignifying.

Action based on the recollection of what we have read, of the ideal to which we aspire, of the norm of conduct that we have been taught, of the experiences accumulated in memory, etc., is calculating, depends on the depressing option, is dualistic, is based on conceptual choice, and only inevitably leads to error and pain.

That business of adjusting action to recollection, that of trying to modify action to coincide with the memories accumulated in memory, is something artificial, absurd, without spontaneity, and that inevitably can only lead us to error and pain.

That business of taking exams, that of passing the year, is done by any fool who has a good dose of cunning and memory.

Understanding the subjects that have been studied and in which we are going to be examined is something very different; it has nothing to do with memory; it belongs to true intelligence, which should not be confused with intellectualism.

Those people who want to base all the acts of their lives on the ideals, theories, and memories of all kinds accumulated in the storehouses of memory are always comparing, and where there is comparison, there is also envy. These people compare themselves, their families, their children with the children of the neighbor, with the people nearby. They compare their house, their furniture, their clothes, all their things, with the things of the neighbor or neighbors or the fellow man. They compare their ideas, the intelligence of their children with the ideas of other people, with the intelligence of other people, and then comes envy, which then becomes the secret spring of action.

Unfortunately for the world, the whole mechanism of society is based on envy and acquisitiveness. Everyone envies everyone else. We envy ideas, things, people, and we want to acquire money and more money, new theories, new ideas that we accumulate in memory, new things to dazzle our peers, etc.

In TRUE, legitimate, authentic COMPREHENSION, there is true love and not mere verbalization of memory.

The things that are remembered, that which is entrusted to memory, soon falls into oblivion because memory is unfaithful. Students deposit in the storehouses of memory ideals, theories, complete texts that are useless in practical life because they eventually disappear from memory without leaving a trace.

People who only live reading and reading mechanically, people who enjoy storing theories among the storehouses of memory, destroy the mind, damage it miserably.

We do not speak out against true, profound, and conscious study based on deep understanding. We only condemn the outdated methods of untimely pedagogy. We condemn all mechanical systems of study, all memorization, etc. Recollection is unnecessary where there is true understanding.

We need to study, useful books are needed, schoolteachers, colleges, universities are needed. The GURU, the spiritual guides, mahatmas, etc., are needed, but it is necessary to understand the teachings integrally and not merely deposit them among the storehouses of unfaithful memory.

We can never be truly free as long as we have the bad taste of comparing ourselves with the memory accumulated in memory, with the ideal, with what we aspire to be and are not, etc.

When we truly understand the teachings received, we do not need to remember them in memory or turn them into ideals.

Where there is comparison of what we are here and now with what we want to become later, where there is comparison of our practical life with the ideal or model to which we want to adapt, true love cannot exist.

All comparison is abominable; all comparison brings fear, envy, pride, etc. Fear of not achieving what we want, envy for the progress of others, pride because we believe we are superior to others. The important thing in the practical life in which we live, whether we are ugly, envious, selfish, greedy, etc., is not to presume to be saints, to start from absolute zero, and to understand ourselves deeply, as we really are and not as we want to be or as we presume to be.

It is impossible to dissolve the I, the MYSELF, if we do not learn to observe ourselves, to perceive in order to understand what we really are here and now in an effective and absolutely practical way.

If we really want to understand, we must listen to our teachers, gurus, priests, preceptors, spiritual guides, etc.

The boys and girls of the new wave have lost the sense of respect, of veneration for our parents, teachers, spiritual guides, gurus, mahatmas, etc.

It is impossible to understand the teachings when we do not know how to venerate and respect our parents, teachers, preceptors, or spiritual guides.

The simple mechanical recollection of what we have learned only by memory without deep understanding mutilates the mind and the heart and engenders envy, fear, pride, etc.

When we truly know how to listen consciously and deeply, a wonderful power arises within us, a formidable understanding, natural, simple, free from all mechanical process, free from all cerebration, free from all recollection.

If the student's brain is relieved of the enormous effort of memory that he must make, it will be entirely possible to teach the structure of the nucleus and the periodic table of the elements to secondary school students and to make a high school student understand relativity and Quanta.

As we have talked with some secondary school teachers, we understand that they are terrified with true fanaticism of the old, outdated, and untimely pedagogy. They want students to learn everything by heart, even if they don't understand it.

Sometimes they accept that it is better to understand than to memorize, but then they insist that the formulas of physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc. must be engraved in memory.

It is clear that this concept is false because when a formula of physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc., is duly understood not only at the intellectual level but also at the other levels of the mind such as the unconscious, subconscious, infraconscious, etc., etc., etc., it does not need to be engraved in memory; it becomes part of our psyche and can manifest as immediate instinctive knowledge when circumstances of life require it.

This INTEGRAL knowledge gives us a form of OMNISCIENCE, a mode of conscious objective manifestation.

Deep understanding and at all levels of the mind is only possible through deep introspective meditation.
