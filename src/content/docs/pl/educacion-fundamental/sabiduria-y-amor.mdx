Wisdom and Love are the two cornerstones of all true civilization.

On one side of the scales of justice, we must place Wisdom; on the other, Love.

Wisdom and Love must balance each other. Wisdom without Love is a destructive element. Love without Wisdom can lead us to error: "LOVE IS LAW, BUT CONSCIOUS LOVE."

It is necessary to study hard and acquire knowledge, but it is also URGENT to develop the SPIRITUAL BEING within us.

Knowledge without a well-developed SPIRITUAL BEING in harmony within us becomes the cause of what is called ROGUERY.

A well-developed BEING within us, but without any intellectual knowledge, gives rise to stupid Saints.

A stupid Saint possesses a highly developed SPIRITUAL BEING, but since they have no intellectual knowledge, they cannot do anything because they do not know how.

THE stupid SAINT has the power to Do, but cannot do because they do not know how.

Intellectual knowledge without a well-developed SPIRITUAL BEING produces intellectual confusion, perversity, pride, etc., etc.

During World War II, thousands of scientists, devoid of all Spiritual element, committed appalling crimes in the name of science and humanity to conduct scientific experiments.

We need to develop a powerful intellectual culture, but one that is tremendously balanced with true conscious Spirituality.

We need a REVOLUTIONARY ETHIC and a REVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY if we truly want to dissolve the EGO to develop the legitimately Spiritual BEING within us.

It is unfortunate that, due to a lack of LOVE, people use the INTELLECT destructively.

Students need to study science, history, mathematics, etc., etc.

It is necessary to acquire vocational knowledge to be useful to others.

Studying is necessary. Accumulating basic knowledge is indispensable, but fear is not indispensable.

Many people accumulate knowledge out of fear; they are Afraid of life, death, hunger, misery, what people will say, etc., and for that reason, they study.

One should study out of Love for our fellow human beings with the desire to serve them better, but one should never study out of fear.

In practical life, we have seen that all those students who study out of fear sooner or later become rogues.

We need to be honest with ourselves to self-observe and discover in ourselves all the processes of fear.

We must never forget in life that fear has many phases. Sometimes fear is confused with courage. Soldiers on the battlefield seem very courageous, but in reality, they move and fight because of fear. The suicide also seems very courageous at first glance, but in reality, they are a coward who is afraid of life.

Every rogue in life pretends to be very courageous, but deep down they are a coward. Rogues tend to use their profession and power destructively when they are afraid. Example: Castro Rúa in Cuba.

We never speak out against the experience of practical life or against the cultivation of the intellect, but we condemn the lack of LOVE.

Knowledge and life experiences are destructive when LOVE is lacking.

The EGO tends to trap experiences and intellectual knowledge when there is an absence of what is called LOVE.

The EGO abuses experiences and the intellect when it uses them to strengthen itself.

By disintegrating the EGO, I, MYSELF, experiences and the Intellect remain in the hands of the INTIMATE BEING, and all abuse then becomes impossible.

Every student should be guided by the vocational path and study in depth all the theories related to their vocation.

Study, the intellect, does not harm anyone, but we must not abuse the intellect.

We need to study so as not to abuse the mind. One abuses the mind who wants to study the theories of different vocations, who wants to harm others with the intellect, who exerts violence on the minds of others, etc., etc., etc.

It is necessary to study professional and spiritual subjects to have a balanced mind.

It is URGENT to reach intellectual SYNTHESIS and Spiritual synthesis if we truly want a balanced mind.

Teachers of schools, colleges, universities, etc., should study our Revolutionary Psychology in depth if they truly want to lead their students along the path of FUNDAMENTAL REVOLUTION.

It is necessary for students to acquire the SPIRITUAL BEING, to develop the TRUE BEING within themselves, so that they leave school as responsible individuals and not as stupid ROGUES.

Wisdom without Love is useless. Intellect without Love only produces Rogues.

Wisdom in itself is Atomic Substance, Atomic capital that should only be administered by individuals full of true Love.
