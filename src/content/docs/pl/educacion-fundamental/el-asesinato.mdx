Killing is obviously and undeniably the most destructive and corrupt act known in the world.

The worst form of murder is destroying the lives of our fellow human beings.

Horrifyingly awful is the hunter who, with his shotgun, kills the innocent creatures of the forest, but a thousand times more monstrous, a thousand times more abominable, is the one who murders his fellow human beings.

One does not only kill with machine guns, shotguns, cannons, pistols, or atomic bombs; one can also kill with a look that wounds the heart, a humiliating look, a look full of contempt, a look full of hatred; or one can kill with an ungrateful action, with a dark action, or with an insult, or with a hurtful word.

The world is full of parricides and ungrateful matricides who have murdered their fathers and mothers, either with their gazes, their words, or their cruel actions.

The world is full of men who unknowingly have murdered their wives, and of women who unknowingly have murdered their husbands.

To top off the misfortunes in this cruel world in which we live, human beings kill what they love most.

Man does not live by bread alone, but also by various psychological factors.

Many husbands could have lived longer if their wives had allowed them to.

Many wives could have lived longer if their husbands had allowed them to.

Many fathers and mothers could have lived longer if their sons and daughters had allowed them to.

The disease that takes our loved one to the grave has as its causa causorum words that kill, gazes that wound, ungrateful actions, etc.

This decadent and degenerate society is full of unconscious murderers who presume themselves innocent.

The prisons are full of murderers, but the worst kind of criminals presume themselves innocent and walk free.

No form of murder can have any justification whatsoever. Killing another does not solve any problem in life.

Wars have never solved any problem. Bombing defenseless cities and murdering millions of people solves nothing.

War is something too crude, rough, monstrous, abominable. Millions of sleeping, unconscious, stupid human machines launch themselves into war with the purpose of destroying as many millions of unconscious human machines.

Often, a planetary catastrophe in the cosmos, or a terrible position of the stars in the sky, is enough for millions of men to launch themselves into war.

Human machines have no awareness of anything; they move in a destructive way when a certain type of cosmic wave secretly wounds them.

If people awakened their consciousness, if from the very benches of the school, students were wisely educated, leading them to the conscious understanding of what enmity and war are, things would be different; no one would launch themselves into war, and the catastrophic waves of the cosmos would then be used in a different way.

War smells of cannibalism, of cave life, of bestiality of the worst kind, of bow, arrow, spear, orgy of blood; it is clearly incompatible with civilization.

All men in war are cowards, fearful, and the heroes laden with medals are precisely the most cowardly, the most fearful.

The suicidal person also seems very brave, but is a coward because they were afraid of life.

The hero is, deep down, a suicidal person who, in an instant of supreme terror, committed the folly of the suicidal person.

The madness of the suicidal person is easily confused with the valor of the hero.

If we carefully observe the soldier's conduct during the war, his manners, his gaze, his words, his steps in battle, we can demonstrate his total cowardice.

The teachers of schools, colleges, universities must teach their students the truth about war. They must lead their students to consciously experience that Truth.

If people had full awareness of what this tremendous Truth of war is, if the teachers knew how to wisely educate their disciples, no citizen would allow themselves to be led to the slaughterhouse.

Fundamental Education must be imparted right now in all schools, colleges, and universities, because it is precisely from the benches of the school where one must work for PEACE.

It is urgent that the new generations become fully aware of what barbarism is and what war is.

In the schools, colleges, universities, enmity and war must be thoroughly understood in all their aspects.

The new generations must understand that the old, with their stale and clumsy ideas, always sacrifice the young and lead them like oxen to the slaughterhouse.

The young must not allow themselves to be convinced by warmongering propaganda, nor by the reasons of the old, because one reason is opposed by another reason and one opinion is opposed by another, but neither the reasonings nor the opinions are the Truth about War.

The old have thousands of reasons to justify war and lead the young to the slaughterhouse.

The important thing is not the reasonings about war but to experience the Truth of what war is.

We do not pronounce ourselves against Reason or against analysis; we only want to say that we must first experience the truth about war, and then we can afford to reason and analyze.

It is impossible to experience the truth of DO NOT KILL if we exclude deep intimate meditation.

Only very deep Meditation can lead us to experience the Truth about War.

Teachers should not only give intellectual information to their students. Teachers must teach their students to manage the mind, to experience the TRUTH.

This decadent and degenerate Race no longer thinks of anything but killing. This killing and killing is only characteristic of any degenerate human race.

Through television and cinema, the agents of crime propagate their criminal ideas.

The children of the new generation receive daily through the television screen and children's stories and cinema, magazines, etc., a good poisonous dose of murders, shootings, gruesome crimes, etc.

You can no longer turn on the television without encountering words full of hatred, bullets, perversity.

The governments of the earth are doing nothing against the propagation of crime.

The minds of children and young people are being led by the agents of crime, down the path of crime.

The idea of killing is already so propagated, already so disseminated through films, stories, etc., that it has become totally familiar to everyone.

The rebels of the new wave have been educated for crime and kill for the pleasure of killing, they enjoy seeing others die. They learned it on the television at home, in the cinema, in the stories, in the magazines.

Crime reigns everywhere, and governments do nothing to correct the instinct to kill from its very roots.

It is up to the teachers of schools, colleges, and universities to raise their voices to heaven and turn heaven and earth upside down to correct this mental epidemic.

It is urgent that the teachers of schools, colleges, and universities sound the alarm and ask all the governments of the earth for censorship for cinema, television, etc.

Crime is multiplying terribly due to all those spectacles of blood, and at the rate we are going, the day will come when no one will be able to circulate freely through the streets without fear of being murdered.

The Radio, the Cinema, the Television, the Magazines of blood, have given such propagation to the crime of killing, have made it so agreeable to weak and degenerate minds, that no one feels remorse in shooting or stabbing another person.

By dint of so much propagation of the crime of killing, weak minds have become too familiar with crime, and now they even indulge in killing to imitate what they saw in the cinema or on television.

The teachers who are the educators of the people are obliged in fulfillment of their duty to fight for the new generations, asking the Governments of the earth for the prohibition of the spectacles of blood, in short, the cancellation of all kinds of films about murders, thieves, etc.

The struggle of the teachers must also extend to bullfighting and boxing.

The type of the bullfighter is the most cowardly and criminal type. The bullfighter wants all the advantages for himself and kills to amuse the public.

The type of the boxer is that of the monster of murder, in its sadistic form that wounds and kills to amuse the public.

This kind of spectacle of blood is barbaric in a hundred percent and stimulates minds, directing them down the path of crime. If we really want to fight for the Peace of the World, we must initiate a thorough campaign against spectacles of blood.

As long as destructive factors exist within the human mind, there will inevitably be wars.

Within the human mind, there are the factors that produce war; these factors are hatred, violence in all its aspects, selfishness, anger, fear, criminal instincts, warmongering ideas propagated by television, radio, cinema, etc.

The propaganda for PEACE, the NOBEL PEACE prizes are absurd as long as the Psychological factors that produce war exist within man.

Currently, many murderers have the NOBEL PEACE prize.
