From the school benches themselves, students must understand in an INTEGRAL way what is called LOVE.

FEAR and DEPENDENCE are often confused with LOVE, but they are not LOVE.

Students depend on their parents and teachers, and it is clear that they respect and fear them at the same time.

Children, youth, and young adults depend on their parents for clothing, food, money, shelter, etc., and it is clear that they feel protected, know that they depend on their parents, and therefore respect and even fear them, but that is not LOVE.

As an example of what we are saying, we can verify with complete accuracy that every child, youth, or young adult trusts their school friends more than their own parents.

Children, youth, and young adults really talk to their classmates about intimate things that they would never in their lives talk about with their own parents.

This is demonstrating that there is no true trust between children and parents, that there is no true LOVE.

It is URGENT to understand that there is a radical difference between LOVE and what is respect, fear, dependence, and dread.

It is URGENT to know how to respect our parents and teachers, but not to confuse respect with LOVE.

RESPECT and LOVE must be INTIMATELY UNITED, but we must not confuse one with the other.

Parents fear for their children, want the best for them—a good profession, a good marriage, protection, etc.—and confuse that fear with true LOVE.

It is necessary to understand that without TRUE LOVE, it is impossible for parents and teachers to guide new generations wisely, even with very good intentions.

The road to the ABYSS is paved with VERY GOOD INTENTIONS.

We see the globally known case of "REBELS WITHOUT A CAUSE." This is a mental epidemic that has spread throughout the world. Multitudes of "GOOD KIDS," supposedly very loved by their parents, very pampered, very cherished, assault defenseless passersby, beat and rape women, steal, throw stones, run in gangs causing damage everywhere, disrespect teachers and parents, etc. etc. etc.

"REBELS WITHOUT A CAUSE" are the product of a lack of true LOVE.

Where true LOVE exists, "REBELS WITHOUT A CAUSE" cannot exist.

If parents TRULY LOVED their children, they would know how to guide them intelligently, and then "REBELS WITHOUT A CAUSE" would not exist.

Rebels without a cause are the product of poor guidance.

Parents have not had enough LOVE to truly dedicate themselves to guiding their children wisely.

Modern parents only think about money and giving their children more and more—a state-of-the-art car, the latest fashions, etc.—but they do not truly love, they do not know how to love, and therefore "rebels without a cause" exist.

The superficiality of this era is due to a lack of TRUE LOVE.

Modern life is like a puddle without depth.

In the deep lake of life, many creatures, many fish, can live, but the puddle located on the side of the road soon dries up with the burning rays of the sun, and then all that remains is mud, rot, ugliness.

It is impossible to understand the beauty of life in all its splendor if we have not learned to LOVE.

People confuse respect and fear with what is called LOVE.

We respect our superiors and fear them, and then we believe that we love them.

Children fear their parents and teachers and respect them, and then believe that they love them, but in reality, they only fear them.

The child fears the whip, the ruler, a bad grade, a scolding at home or at school, etc., and then believes that they love their parents and teachers, but in reality, they only fear them.

We depend on employment, on the boss, we fear misery, losing our job, and then we believe that we love the boss and even watch over their interests, take care of their property, but that is not LOVE, that is fear.

Many people are afraid to think for themselves about the mysteries of life and death, afraid to inquire, investigate, understand, study, etc., and then exclaim, "I LOVE GOD, AND THAT'S ENOUGH!"

They believe they love GOD, but in reality, they do not LOVE, they fear.

In times of war, the wife feels that she adores her husband more than ever and yearns with infinite anxiety for his return home, but in reality, she does not love him, she only fears being left without a husband, without protection, etc. etc. etc.

Psychological slavery, dependence, depending on someone, is not LOVE. It is only FEAR, and that is all.

The child in their studies depends on the TEACHER, and it is clear that they fear EXPULSION, a bad grade, a scolding, and often believes that they LOVE them, but what happens is that they fear them.

When the wife is in labor or in danger of death from any illness, the husband believes that he loves her much more, but in reality, what happens is that he fears losing her, depends on her in many things, such as food, sex, laundry, caresses, etc., and fears losing her. That is not LOVE.

Everyone says that they adore everyone, but that is not the case: it is very rare to find someone in life who knows how to LOVE TRULY.

If parents truly loved their children, if children truly loved their parents, if teachers truly loved their students, there could be no wars. Wars would be one hundred percent impossible.

What happens is that people have not understood what love is, and they confuse all fear and all psychological slavery, and all passion, etc., with what is called LOVE.

People do not know how to LOVE; if people knew how to love, life would indeed be a paradise.

LOVERS believe that they are loving, and many would even be willing to swear in blood that they are loving. But they are only PASSIONATE. Once the PASSION is satisfied, the house of cards collapses.

PASSION often deceives the MIND and the HEART. Every PASSIONATE person believes that they are IN LOVE.

It is very rare to find a truly loving couple in life. Passionate couples abound, but it is very difficult to find a couple IN LOVE.

All artists sing to LOVE, but they do not know what LOVE is and confuse PASSION with LOVE.

If there is anything very difficult in this life, it is NOT confusing PASSION with LOVE.

PASSION is the most delicious and subtle poison that can be conceived; it always ends up triumphing at the price of blood.

PASSION is one hundred percent SEXUAL, PASSION is bestial, but sometimes it is also very refined and subtle. It is always confused with LOVE.

Teachers must teach students, youth, and young adults to differentiate between LOVE and PASSION. Only in this way will many tragedies in life be avoided later.

Teachers are obligated to form the responsibility of students and therefore must prepare them properly so that they do not become tragic in life.

It is necessary to understand what LOVE is, what cannot be mixed with jealousy, passions, violence, fear, attachments, psychological dependence, etc. etc. etc.

LOVE, unfortunately, does not exist in human beings, but neither is it something that can be ACQUIRED, bought, or cultivated like a greenhouse flower, etc.

LOVE must be BORN in us, and it only IS BORN when we have deeply understood what the HATRED we carry within is, what FEAR, SEXUAL PASSION, dread, psychological slavery, dependence, etc. etc. etc. are.

We must understand what these PSYCHOLOGICAL defects are, we must understand how they are processed in us, not only at the intellectual level of life, but also at other hidden and unknown levels of the SUBCONSCIOUS.

It is necessary to extract all those defects from the various nooks and crannies of the mind. Only then is what is called LOVE born in us spontaneously and purely.

It is impossible to want to transform the world without the flame of LOVE. Only LOVE can truly transform the world.
