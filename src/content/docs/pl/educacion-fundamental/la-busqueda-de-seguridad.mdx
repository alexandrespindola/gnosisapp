When chicks are frightened, they hide under the hen's loving wings for safety.

A scared child runs to their mother because they feel safe by her side.

It is thus demonstrated that FEAR and the search for SECURITY are always intimately associated.

A man who fears being attacked by bandits seeks security in his pistol.

A country that fears being attacked by another country will buy cannons, planes, warships, and arm armies, preparing for war.

Many individuals who do not know how to work, terrified of poverty, seek security in crime and become thieves, assailants, etc.

Many unintelligent women, frightened by the possibility of poverty, become prostitutes.

A jealous man fears losing his wife and seeks security in a pistol, kills, and then clearly ends up in jail.

A jealous woman kills her rival or her husband and thus becomes a murderer.

She fears losing her husband and, wanting to secure him, kills the other woman or resolves to murder him.

A fearful landlord, afraid that people will not pay their rent, demands contracts, guarantors, deposits, etc., wanting to ensure payment. If a poor widow with many children cannot meet such tremendous requirements, and if all the landlords in a city do the same, the unfortunate woman will ultimately have to sleep with her children on the street or in city parks.

All wars originate in fear.

The Gestapos, tortures, concentration camps, Siberias, appalling prisons, exiles, forced labor, executions, etc., originate in fear.

Nations attack other nations out of fear; they seek security in violence, believing that by killing, invading, etc., they can become secure, strong, and powerful.

In secret police and counter-espionage offices, both in the East and the West, spies are tortured. They are feared, and authorities want to make them confess in order to find security for the State.

All crimes, all wars, all atrocities originate in fear and the search for security.

In the past, there was sincerity among people; today, fear and the search for security have destroyed the wonderful fragrance of sincerity.

A friend distrusts a friend, fearing that the latter will steal from, defraud, or exploit them. There are even stupid and perverse maxims such as this: "NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR BEST FRIEND." The HITLERIANS said that this MAXIM was GOLDEN.

Now a friend fears a friend and even uses MAXIMS to protect themselves. There is no longer sincerity between friends. Fear and the search for security have destroyed the delightful fragrance of sincerity.

Castro in Cuba has executed thousands of citizens, fearing that they will overthrow him; Castro seeks security by executing. He believes that he can find security in this way.

Stalin, the perverse and bloodthirsty Stalin, tainted Russia with his bloody purges. That was his way of seeking security.

Hitler organized the Gestapo, the terrible Gestapo, for the security of the State. There is no doubt that he feared being overthrown, and that is why he founded the bloody Gestapo.

All the bitterness of this world originates in fear and the search for security.

Schoolteachers should teach students the virtue of courage.

It is lamentable that children are filled with fear from their very homes.

Children are threatened, intimidated, terrorized, beaten, etc.

It is customary for parents and teachers to frighten children and young people in order to make them study.

Children and young people are commonly told that if they do not study, they will have to beg, wander hungry through the streets, perform very humble jobs such as shining shoes, carrying bundles, selling newspapers, working in the fields, etc. etc. etc. (As if work were a crime.)

Deep down, behind all these words from parents and teachers, there is fear for the child and a search for security for the child.

The serious thing about everything we are saying is that children and young people become insecure and filled with fear and later in practical life are individuals full of fear.

Parents and teachers who have the bad habit of scaring children, adolescents, and young adults are unconsciously leading them down the path of crime because, as we have already said, all crime originates in fear and the search for security.

Today, FEAR and the SEARCH FOR SECURITY have turned planet Earth into a horrifying hell. Everyone is afraid. Everyone wants security.

In the past, one could travel freely; now, borders are full of armed guards, and passports and certificates of all kinds are required to have the right to pass from one country to another.

All this is the result of fear and the SEARCH FOR SECURITY. Travelers and newcomers are feared, and security is sought in passports and papers of all kinds.

Teachers in schools, colleges, and universities must understand the horror of all this and cooperate for the good of the world, knowing how to educate new generations, teaching them the path of authentic courage.

It is URGENT to teach new generations not to fear and not to seek security in anything or anyone.

It is essential that every individual learn to trust themselves more.

FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY are terrible weaknesses that have turned life into a horrifying HELL.

Cowards, fearful people, and weaklings who are always in search of SECURITY abound everywhere.

There is fear of life, fear of death, fear of what people will say, of rumors, of losing social standing, political position, prestige, money, a beautiful house, a beautiful wife, a good husband, a job, a business, a monopoly, furniture, a car, etc. etc. etc. Everything is feared. Cowards, fearful people, and weaklings abound everywhere, but no one believes themselves to be a coward; everyone pretends to be strong, courageous, etc.

In all social classes, there are thousands and millions of interests that people fear losing, and therefore everyone seeks security that, by becoming increasingly complex, in fact makes life increasingly complicated, increasingly difficult, increasingly bitter, cruel, and ruthless.

All gossip, all slander, intrigues, etc., originate in fear and the search for security.

In order not to lose wealth, position, power, or prestige, slander and gossip are spread, people are murdered, and people are paid to murder in secret, etc.

The powerful of the earth indulge in the luxury of having hired and well-paid assassins with the disgusting purpose of eliminating anyone who threatens to eclipse them.

They love power for its own sake and secure it with money and much blood.

Newspapers are constantly reporting many cases of suicide.

Many believe that someone who commits suicide is courageous, but really, someone who commits suicide is a coward who is afraid of life and seeks security in the bare arms of death.

Some war heroes were known as weak and cowardly people, but when they came face to face with death, their terror was so appalling that they turned into terrible beasts seeking security for their lives, making a supreme effort against death. Then they were declared HEROES.

Fear is often confused with courage. Someone who commits suicide seems very courageous, someone who carries a gun seems very courageous, but in reality, suicides and gunmen are very cowardly.

Someone who is not afraid of life does not commit suicide. Someone who is not afraid of anyone does not carry a gun on their belt.

It is URGENT that schoolteachers teach citizens clearly and precisely what true VALOR is and what fear is.

FEAR and the SEARCH for SECURITY have turned the world into a horrifying hell.
